Misty : "then as i was about to ride my in-you-words
"godforsaken" bike,i just turned around to have a last look
at you.."
Ash(hugging Misty) : "just for clarification,Mist,that song
you were humming that day from Kelly Trooper's
Rockmore Woods-"Cutain Call",which we jointly roasted(both laugh) to soul it up(both smile), 
that um..if i weren't an
utter buffoon then,i would've instantly atleast have a
private talk with you or well..um..i've never thought itself
but why I didn't go to Cerulian myself that day?i barely
knew there was something called Hoenn in this world.."
Misty(smirk) : "parting with each other actually broadened
both our gazes, don't you think?"
Ash(irritated) : "whatever!i just want to fondle my flower
all the time(smile,Misty giggles)..but the next one year if
any vulture and especially the Cerulian breed tries to
insinuate that i must stay away My wife for a full 12 hours
due to some godforsaken work,then i'll.."
Misty(brust into laughter) : "Ash,i would've been in a big
trouble had you infact tried to come with me that day
cause we were 17 and that though was a Gym still my
home also..plas(giggle)..that bike ONLY had ONE
seat(laughing),else it would've been another night outside
and um..you know you might've been.."
Ash(giggle) : "endangered?"Misty(laugh) : "exactly"
Ash : "i've always wondered to which Cerulian bonehead
did this idea occur to not give an extra seat in the bike so
that people may carry others yet gave a god damn basket
in front which was oversized and made the control
almost impossible that too in a godforbidden forest like
Viridian,which i guess i still may get lost in(laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "Master in Cerulian Hating should be your
title you know"
Ash(scowl) : "i never found anything good there EXCEPT
my most cherished flower(hugging Misty,Misty
giggles),and my badge too was due to her"
Misty(smile) : "well,atleast we battled,Dase really made a
mess out of the situation"
Ash(laugh) : "never saw anything like before or after..
Sensational Trio in all aspects,no they have no match,still"
Misty(smile) : "Voil would be in Cerulian the very next day
i never knew"
Ash (laugh) : "all she did was to panick all over the place
long enough to force the police to start interrogating till
Lance forbade them.have you called Violet?"
Misty(smile) : "yes,she was the first one to see the
judgement day death note you rather shoved through my"
earsAsh(grim) : "um..was i too..um..loud?"
Misty(laugh) : "Ash,your another gem like my sisters,that
day's theatrics as i later heard were brilliant,if you were in
our show at your present form,we would have had to turn
the building into showhouse only cause even 4 of us
wouldn't have had any time to manage the pokmeons let
alone the Gym Battles but as soon as you would've
realized that your Cerulian-Vultures were going to your
Insinuate something,we would've been driven out of the
city itself"
Ash(laugh) : "i guess"
Misty : "i turned back and saw Brock returning and you
had your head down murmuring something..
Ash : "um..i was going to part with you three after 5
years,well Brock left,Tracy left but that day you..you never
went away from me even for a moment Mist in all those 5
years,you didn't even go home,rather staying with me only
with phone contact i remembered that Daisy and all
weren't then exactly showing there care to you so you
were rather happy with me and when i returned home
after 3 years,you stayed in my home infact for all those 3
days(laugh) that was too much for my break.."
Misty(laugh) : "sure,how many days did you halt
afterwards?"Ash(smile) : "you and Brock- your memory was troubling
me after Jhoto and as soon as i went home,next day
heard Hoenn,next day out,2 nights,Hoenn to Battle
Frontier,6 nights and you were there,May was beaking my
head whole day since she saw me alone with you in the
balcony..and um..you then had already reached a pretty
high level for a 19 year old,and i saw you suddenly just
after getting inside home and was then an utter jerk to
say in reply to you ever sweet greeting "hi Ash!" I said
rather in a flustered state "yeah! Hi! what are you doing
you?" and you came to congratulate me on my Hoenn
victory"
Misty(laugh) : "you were so childish even at 19,but i just
cherished that sweetness of yours ever so much"
Ash : "yeah as i said that,you just smirked rather as you
expected something like that by then and congratulated
me..but,you'll forever be a miracle monger to me sisnce
that day our reunion in Hoenn,i saw Gyarados and then
the flamethrower,i was rather so jealous of you as i
thought i want Gyarados and also more so cause i had
very few pokemon as i was new to hoenn,but then..
(blush)..um..i turned back at you and you were smirking
at me saying that it was rather very impressive than only
impressive with a rather proud face then i went intoflashback and recalled,and i'm naratting this to you now
cause i was too flustered before to do so but you looked
nice that day,i already felt a strange feeling that since very
last days of Jhoto was being more apparent to me but i
never quite bothered.."
Misty(smile) : "you were thinking a too much about me
and gazing at me a bit too much and a bit longer and a bit
more intently by the end of Jhoto,i was in cloud 9 and
Brock also told me but you know what he was then to just
as usual jump into the sea(laugh).."
Ash(smile) : "yeah i guess i never before that considered
you as a great playmate,but as i said,as you were looking
at Gyarados i looked at you constantly and intently a bit
and then followed you after that closely,how you took the
pokeball,kissed it as if you knew you would win,which i
never till then myself could do so confidently,and released
Gyarados of all pokemons..i really was amused,just how
self confident you were,and Mist,it was the i realized
jealousy but as later i returned from flashback i thought
may be i could beat Gyarados too but your disposition did
entice me..when in Hoenn during the reunion i was just
overjoyed to be able to see you and so did you.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah,during my 5 years i was all about
following you,fighting you and longing for you,the Gym suddenly such a huge responsibility and your memories
just made had in those mere 9 months turned me into
a grown up lady"
Ash(smile) : "exactly, that's what i did saw,i saw the
Cerulian City Gym Leader Misty Waterflower not my
playmate Mist anymore(Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s hair)..no Mist,you know what as sweet as you are,i just still cherish your that cute little sweetness that you were when we first met and the reason is simply because that dumb Gym..i never felt you had the time to enjoy yourself more which i had in Hoenn after which i got a better foothold on things,but for me i just feel your pain now Mist..you know great Gym leader is one thing and my sweet Mist is another,now i realize that sudden maturity of yours didn’t do you much favour as dumb buffoons instantly jumped upon you..if you got that Hoenn or may be another year atleast in fact you could’ve become what i’m now,always fooling around,everfree,totally careless,totally free from anything-this Mist is your real nature as now as know.(Misty smiles,tendering Ash’s cheeks).you know Mist,i’ve had my respect and i’ve had my reservations for all in this world of Pokemon professionally involved and even for team rocket..but now i just feel that all is a bondage to me atleast for sure this idea of responsibility in this profession regarding this exact word pokemon battle(Misty smiles)..i can just laugh at anyone saying responsibility that they feel cause i know by soul no such thing exists...you want to be a gym leader you should be but i just don’t like this idea of responsibility at all and i want to take that upon myself cause battling for me is done for this life,i’ve got nothing to do except to fool around and that’s how i’ll make responsibility a complete joke and fun that’s all..Mist,i just want you to get rid of this dumb idea of responsibility for a f.. Gym,Pokemons,your family different stuff,but this Gym that hasn’t ever done you a good and had almost killed you by slow poisoning which another dumb buffon like me didn’t realize then due to utter ignorance..just don’t bother about dumbnuts trying to win badges,Mist you know me,i wouldn’t care a fig if a gym is closed for that day,i’ll move along to next and so on,these brats should realize that a badge has to earned and not just you can arrive and it’ll be handed over to you after may be your first 3 gyms,Brock did hand it over but i wouldn’t have stopped if he didn’t,i wouldn’t have stopped if Daisy had beaten me that day rather than just giving me the badge away..that’s what i want if anything to see in people who wants to do Pokemon Training..one has to move forward and that’s all otherwise why bother coming here at all..and no Mist,no matter what you say,as long as i’m in Cerulian,no brat gets to challege unless they know how to behave properly and give right respect no matter what he or she thinks inside...to me it’s all about your bunch and that’s how it should be no matter where and every hall of fame gym that i’ve seen was exactly like that except this damn Cerulian..but every Gym must be like that in my ideal picture,what responsibility does a gym leader has to babysit a buffon who doesn’t know what he’s doing in the first place?..the answer is absolutely none,and that’s how it should be...i just want this Mist that’s all,nothing else,just don’t think you have any responsibility to anyone if they are incompetent enough to not behave properly,just let me drive them away,they’ve got a long way to go to become a sane person first and then handle their own bunch then think of training then set a goal gym is the last step,if one can’t do that,atleast Cerulian isn’t for them as long as i have to see them day after day and see my sweet flower getting drained day after day..4 on 4 no restrictions,battle or bust..you’ll understand the challengers capasity after the first round itself you don’t have to go till 4th being a Gym leader,but the pests will think twice on a four on four strict stuff..those brats uttering attack this and that..just fed up with it am I completely and it’s so much fun if the two really are respectful to each other,barely found it..finally my thing is that just don’t think that it’s your responsibility to babysit doomsday goblins out of their infatuated slumbers..they will get their food thrown somewhere else,my sweet flower’s sweetness would be cheated upon i won’t tolerate that if i’m in the gym and as soon as you went back buffons started to roam around and it was those 4 dumb buffons to come first will not be sane for long(Misty laughs and shakes her head),i just don’t like it at all this idea of responsibility of a gym leader just totally bogus stuff anybody experienced enough knows who deserves what..if the brats don’t understand that’s their retardness not the gym leader’s irresponsibility straight and simple..."
Misty(smile,hugging Ash firmly) : “my sweet little bee,you’re always within me dont worry(Ash smiles and hugs Misty very yfirmly).everybody isn’t you Ash,just give them a chance,what you could do with any gym which i myself saw i know,very rare people can do that and in Kalos atleast you had long surpassed anything imaginable here,you never had any match and yes Brock did tell you many times that Onix wouldn’t have coped up with chu-bro if you just persisted a bit and i get your point and who you ever were but your likes are rare and yes you’re right that the responsibility stuff did get on my nerves but it’s ok,i just ever needed my soulmate that’s all,i’ve in my 12 years barely saw anyone like you except once or twice..though(laugh)..i can already understand what doom awaits even if the Elite4 heads come in there once my fool-around bee steps in(both laugh) with Crawdauntogator(both brusts into laughter)..but just be patient Ash,you’ll have ample time to be with me sweety,don’t worry and alright i myself would love to battle good challengers be it less in number but still atleast say 2 days are for kids,agree?”
Ash(smile,hugging Misty firmly) : “soully...but only a half day(Misty brusts into laughter)and the registration time will be 11-11:15(Misty brusts into laughter)..at Dark Night:Gym Challenger Registration Version(Misty laughs aloud)..if pass that get you badge but unfortunately no legend would dare to play this one(Misty laughs)..just want to chew up each brat that ever cheated on my flowers sweetness and those who will..besides if any pokebrat misbehaves(Misty brusts into laughter),you have apart from my water pests you have an electrician there(both brusts into laughter)..that’s enough...my sweet Mist shouldn’t be away from me long at all(both smiles at each other)..(laugh)..besides Mist,i’m already dreaded enough am not I that you’re AWOL(both brusts into laughter)..”
Misty(smile,tendering Ash’s cheeks) : “soully(both brusts into laughter)..i won’t be away from my bee either(both hugs each other firmly for a few moments)..”
Ash(laughs) : “besides can i bash Cerulian again?(both laughs)”
Misty(laugh) : "Ash,give it a break,we’ll see when we get in,now continue"
Ash(smile) : "right no Cerulian bonehead could disturb me
when i was looking at you,the Gym Leader,then i saw you
had become so established in yourself and my first
jealousy turned into the respect for that i had for a Gym
Leader..(laugh)till i started trash talking them last year.."
Misty(smile) : "but you still have.."
Ash(smile) : "precisely.then i had that respect for you,then
i was rather ashtonished by you and kept a bit more
regular contact because may be um.."
Misty(smile) : "felt insecured with yousrself?"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "i always am unless you're
right here"
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "right!you know for all my
infatuation with you Ash,that reunion i saw you,you also
had grown up but were in same sweet oblivion that i
rather felt a big sister affection for you rather than an
attraction,but i always had my feeling inside me and yourt houghts,it really was a great reunion,but by then
affection had taken over attraction whenever i thought of
you,and um..Ash,a few times then i've had my doubts
whether mine was also a mistake i mean whether it was
true feeling or only infatuation for you.."
Ash(smile) : "Mist, it's just the process till the final union
that we've had where you saw all objects and ideas were absolutely laughed off and we’ve got souled as usual."
Misty(broad smile,hugging Ash) : "exactly".
Ash(smile) : "then i kept up contacts with you which is after Jhoto i contacted you twice in weekends and once in midweek it became 2-2 cause of my journeys but the extra day was for Gyarados(both brusts into laughter)..”
Misty(laugh) : “What did you do to my poor girl yesterday Ash,hum?(both laughs)..”
Ash(laughs) : “well Gyarados being Gyarados ever angry gets ready out comes Heracross with total type disadvantage and also to fool around with my sweety(Misty smirks,Ash tenders her cheeks,Misty hugs Ash firmly) then Heracross said like ‘me 4 legal 2 illegal beaus(both laughs),you one legal and no illegal beaus,match done’(both brusts into laughter)..yeah exactly why she was so puzzled as you know the that bug just played a sentimental type difference nasty joke(both laughs) cause recently the Lab has had a few Gyarados’ and the bug as usual bugged around and extracted this info as to her it’s called beau-counting(both brusts into laughter) and their different antics and so on and her illegal ones are Bulbasaur(both laugh) and Bruneri(both laughs)..the poor girl looked at you and just lied down thinking what world is this even(both brusts into laughter),then i just went and patted her and said like don’t worry al all and she kinda was relieved to get back into the ball rather than being with absolute madcaps(both laughs)..and Mist had i told Nivy(both laugh)..it would’ve been like ‘do you interpret better your masters moods or emotions’(both brusts into laughter)..Gyarados would’ve cried there then...once the opponent for once thinks of anything else apart from just fooling around,my bunch can’t be beaten and the otherwise is that the match doesn’t happen,so always a tie(both smile)..(laugh)..though Mist,except Goldy i guess all are well behaved so don’t ever let your Gyarados to mingle with those two water brats(both laugh)..she’ll make all challenger’s her beaus then(both brusts into laughter)...”
Misty(laughs) : “we should just let them have fun and just give the badges away then(both laughs)..”
Ash(laughs) : “yup,Dark Cerulian Gym:DaisyDevil version(both laughs)...just love that name on poor Daisy(both laughs) but the night has been stupendous just because of that mob..what a night this comrads Cerulian/we must very first get rid of this evil king demon/he gets to a shop as if to get his due/suddenly he declares a ring for his beau(both brusts into laughter)...no Mist never can forget that mob in this life...’you’ve abducted all’,’why would they want Cerulian rings’(both brusts into laughter)”
Misty(laugh) : “Ash,would you finish reminiscensing want some sweet bee buzz(both laughs)”
Ash(smile,huggig Misty firmly) : “right sweety,so then the contacts were more frequent and
always were fun but rather grave and serious
discussion,but then you should tell me about the
handkerchief"
Misty(smile,tendering Ash’s cheeks) : "still has it?"
Ash(dissapointed) : "no,torn it up myself..um.."
Misty(smile) : "didn't spare a single one did you?"
Ash(dissapointed) : "all went the first night itself"
Misty(smile) : "you've always been like this haven't you"
Ash(solemn) : "i guess, don't like to keep junk rather
everything in memory"
Misty(smile,hugging Ash) : "just store this one specially."
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "done."
Misty(smile) : "right,then as you were murmuring and
Brock was approaching you,i finally tried to atleast give
you an ultimate point,then gave you my handkerchief andlater sent you the lure.."
Ash(laugh) : "well the handkerchief helped the very next
day as those 3 buffoons jumped on me.."
Misty(smile) : "thank God they did,else you wouldn't ever
had thought about Keeping it"
Ash(smile) : "might be,but anyway then i kept that with
me.then it just went on,would have a look at it and all..i
didn't miss you i've never missed anyone nor i will but i
guess it was just my longing for you that's all.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah,and the other breaks?"
Ash(smile) : "Sinnoh 1 night(laugh) after i returned from
Cerulian,Unova was 14 nights,then I was in a totally
different domain,break-up,went undercover,came back
again Kalos..Kalos has been my best journey personally
but just that last moment has made it sour..i had
enoumous privacy and i was somewhere else really in
Kalos cause i never needed to think about battle and all total self reflection for around 2 years amusing experience for me that..won all the Badges from hall of fame leaders at full force..know the whole region so
well..and then Elite4..um,it was the point i just wasn't
really sane after that farewell incident in Kalos and then the sludge attack at Unova and that was my ultimate point as i told you after that i just became nasty on any kind of personal relationship,then i
planned,August,October,December,January,March,April,June
that was my plan
Unova,Sinnoh,Hoenn,Kalos,Jhoto,Orange,Kanto...well i
hated to go back to Orange cause you were 17-18
then,with all your blossoming jubilance(Misty laughs) and Trace with his antics(both laugh)..14 years,and I just didn't want to
mingle much..but you know i just knew who i was then..it
just felt like i could turn the whole world over just for
fun..but i really didn't have any objectives..just thought
buy a library in Kalos and spend the rest of my library or
go to Sinnoh and Professor Kukui..and all,then finally
went into Kanto..Lance said what he said..still I went back
to Kalos to have a study further..then once i finished
things actually pained me so much,each time i parted
from you came back and i just became a devil..i realized
my Mistake but more so my longing was now tangible to me which just surpassed all emotions..and had a feeling that you weren't married or
like that,but if you really were..i'm sorry Mist,but i just
might've destroyed the whole Cerulian city and abducted
you or something..i just didn't know what i was doing and
with my level it was hard..Pikachu realized this and he
became very agitated all the time..but as luck may have
it..you were in that condition..and i just jumped upon you
that's all..there was no power that day Mist, Could've
taken you away from me..i'm so sorry i pained you for 12
years being an idiot..i just can't be whole without my
Mist.."
Misty(smile) : "forgetting whom your naratting the story
to,dear?"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "all of memories are so precious to me now only because i'm naratting them to
my sweety!"
Misty(smile) : "ok,lets continue!"
Ash : "yeah,then that Jhoto separation..i was going a bit
poetic about Brock but could only say thank you Misty to
myself as your thoughts were choking me and the more it
went the more i realized what you meant when you said
"would i ever see you" and that song,i just brushed you
aside being childish as it takes if i sat on Charizard then 20
minutes to reach Cerulian,now 3(laughs,Misty sighs and shakes her head,but as soon as you were gone i
just couldn't come into terms you know 5 years not one moment we were away...then team rocket came
then i realized your words and kept that handkerchief
went to phone you from the Lab..on the road i once or
twice said "hey Misty,come look its this or that pokemon"
(Misty smiles) only for chu-bro to remind me that you
weren't there anymore,which after 5 years of constant
company was just too much to take(tears).."
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "sweety,I'm here always"
Ash(clears off tears,smile) : "we grew up with each other
didn't we Mist?"
Misty(smile) : "surely Ash,i myself can't believe it either
that for 5 years not even a day was spent without you"
Ash(smile) : "that got you through in your initial days in
that go..nah just not in a mood.."
Misty(laugh) : "finally the poor Cerulian brats can sleep
well(Ash laughs)(smile) yeah,and you've influenced my
style as well the most though later i found mine"
Ash(smile) : "you and Gyarados have influenced me beyond
measures"
Misty(laugh) : "till that day.."
Ash(smile) : "no,still..(laugh)..well  beau-counting is different plane(both brusts into laughter).."
Misty(laughing) : "you don't need anything anymore"
Ash(smile) : "except you that i have"
Misty(smile) : "right"
Ash : "yeah,well all has been influenced by my style till i started Dark Night:Tickle Tracy Version(both laughs)...but nah your style has a different grace,i was all about intuitive counters and all,you were ever forward yet gracefull and just as i said were so much more powerful than what you showed always so self confident and your abilities,you were eversweet everywhere and my true dream everywhere(both smile at each other) and my Mist is ever dream esque to me never touched by this world of words and ideas..way above my soul my being Mist you’re just me(both hug each other firmly)...all i ever want is to be in the dream to see the dearm that you are,just keep gazing at you for eternity,feel your presence perpetually just my Mist is how i call it(both keep hugging each other very firmly for a few moments)...”
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly) : “Ash,just you”(they keep hugging each other firmly for a few more moments)
Ash(laugh) : “but here about your style i’m using you in past tense cause you know the electricity(both brusts into laughter)..no really Mist you’ll have to change your style pretty drastically cause i have to have him due to my stuffs and that pest is really dangerous(Misty laughs and shakes her head)..unless you really you know play with him and let your bunch play with him,he’ll mid match try to fondle with eveyone cause that to him would signal that this is play(both laugh) and thus all of us would have to be aware of light going out anytime and sudden appearences with tickling(both laughs)...anyhow,then obviously i won Hoenn which kinda made me feel that i really can go the way cause it was my second and i got serious,came to know the rules very well and all that and kept contact with you
but as i was saying you said congratulations while at home and i looked
at you and i just knew you were so much more powerful
than what you showed and i really became a fan and was
kinda.."
Misty(laugh) : "following me around in your own home(both laughs)"
Ash(smile) : “well as i said either me or you physically will do that anyway(both smiles)..yeah,and that little brat picked it it up as i probably
that day had let my arms around you shoulder or
something while star gazing and that was 2 days before
we departed"
Misty : "i was just loving it,i told you i had a strange big
sister affection for you then,but actually it was longing
and i just wanted you to try to fly around me just as i did
for all those years..(giggle) "
Ash(smile) : "and i happily obliged,but(grim)and these m.. didn’t realize that the maturity was too sudden and thus would create mental pressure eventually especially cause she was living and feeding utter buffoons which was the reason why she had to be like a big sister to all otherwise she couldn’t live there in that nonsense mess,and i heard that she was the great queen while the reporters had ulterior motives cause they were abject boneheads..”
Misty(sigh) : “Ash,it was 12 years ago,just beat it”
Ash(laugh) : “can i cheat on Cerulian Mist?”
Misty(frown) : “you..(brusts into laughter)..Ash..”
Ash(hugging Misty very firmly,smile) : “every day selected challengers,natural environment,Charizard will be there,a totally new type of facility,so?why not sweety..hum?..”
Misty(tendering Ash’s hair) : “you’ll be bored cause no vultures will be there(both laughs)”
Ash(looking into Misty’s eyes,hugging her,Misty also hugs Ash and looks into his eyes) : “that’s not the answer and it’s so sweet this idea,hum?..lets runaway?”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “Ash,just..”
Ash(smile,same pose) : “soully”
(they stay in that pose for few momemts)
Ash(smile): “had the right thing,that’s the system”
Misty(smile,looking into Ash’s eyes,hugging him,Ash also hugs Misty and looks into her eyes) : “lets just runaway”
Ash(smile) : “Pinkenberry all day long,just you and me soully together(both keeps the same pose for a moment and then hug each other very firmly for a few more moments)”
Misty(smile) : “alright continue running away(both smile)”
Ash(smile) : “yeah,so May was so
ecstatic and saying propose,propose,propose(Misty
laughs) the whole day next day to which i scoffed her that
she was a mere kid then,to which she scowled and said
she'll keep an watch on me,to which i said till Drew comes
around,at which she just frowned and left telling me if i
don't propose i'll be in deep waters(laugh)"
Misty(bit concerned) : "Ash,May is the best friend,your true little sister
you've ever had,why cut her off?"
Ash(solemn) : "Mist,i just sweared her left and right thats
all,she said-well it was her 1st anniversary with
Drew,actually on phone..um..i regret that really but i..that
was the very next day Serena pulled that b.. stunt which obviously for a(Mist frowns again and shakes her head)..anyway.. and i
already had turned Max off so,um..as soon as her
thoughts appeared and i realized i had always taken
Serena as that as well and she cheating on my trust,i just
couldn't contain myself..and she was the only person that
i never spoken harshly,she was exactly my little sis and
among all if later I trusted someone it was her,became
very vey matured after her Jhoto league and all of you
know her and Drew..both just utterly sweet..i did use harsh
words,which i did to all else including you many times but
not May and Max,well Max was so little then but May,you
just can't be harsh on her,Max I showed my disinterest and he himself took the clue and was off without telling May at all,just like Clemont and Dawn,Cilan was well
he was professional with me thoroughly...well May on her
anniversary said like i couldn't have imagined a better day
and you know better day and i was there,she since she
partes always called me bro or something..and all that i
just lost it..I said get off you being with him and breaking
up makes no sense to me or you,you say its better day as
if it was a big deal and you wouldn't have someone other
than Drew and viseversa..that was a real crime from
me..and she just realized i wasn't on level head cause of
all my things and all that then..but May was the only one
who sympathized with me after our break-up..Drew was
kinda not sure..but May surely..Cilan chided me straight
but said i won't bother about your personal life as he saw
my full change and you and me from so sweet to so
sour,and he is your huge fan..i perfected cooking and all
from him as Brock left..so he has been Professional and
never contacted you i guess since once just after break
up till today?
Misty(bit long faced) : "No he didn't.. just the day after you told him,was
very brief just wished me luck and just how happy he was
to personally know me and all that was it..May kept
contact and was same as she was except any mention of you unless logically impossible,Max was always my huge pet(Ash laughs)..he kept contact,Dawn very rare..later didn't at all but
surprisingly was around Cerulian the day after your antics(Ash
laughs),I threw the party,she was there the next day,told
me heard about it from Pokémon centre and all..was nice
and then you know said i will contact you cause I can't
keep my emotions checked when its about you and all
that(both laugh)...Iris never did contact me afterwards as you said in your case just wanted to move on and
Max recently turned off the last 9/10 months or so,realized
my moods and that was it.."
Ash(bit concerned) : "Mist,just a thing,those stuffs..why
suddenly.."
Misty(sigh) : "just an addiction you know..you were
haunting me and even in the very last days i didn't want to
battle and all..and then started it after the sludge attack and then Dase much later found out,just had a quarrel and then just went a step too far,this made Dase actually scream at mom once mom may have said something about you and so on..you really saved me Ash..no you said that
day you know you're an insane and all sucked up
nothing(Ash hugging Misty firmly)..i would've become exactly that cause..i just
didn't know and every night that picture i thought i'll tear
apart but just couldn't..someone i talked with and even agreed to date,but just that moment at night when i thought about it i just felt like a sword has just pierced through my heart and just hugged that picture cried my head off and would say like leave me and all..i told you just an overdose and i'll
call all to jump..5 months i would've done that,i
would've become completely lunatic..but(beam),then my
sweet bee came and just..(hugging Ash firmly)..I cherish
you so much Ash..so much..soully.."
Ash(hugging Misty firmly,smile) : "my sweetly sweet sweety flower...you know Mist,this exactly was the factor that your very being was me and everyone that came to your personal contact knew it and my great legendary crime was that why i wasn’t exactly like in that aspect and thus i was deemed immature despite me telling those m.. things that helped them the most and that immaturity was what bugged those m.. yet they weren’t prudent enough to just knock me knowing i’m immature saying come back battle prove yourself only whinning like so and so..and them being the greatest legends in maturity were bufoon enough to not take up that damn gym for 10 days or just shut it down for 10 days and if that wasn’t good enough they let sludges float up the groud...just funny Mist,just funny as i said yesterday all about your not you..i never needed to prove anything to you and viseversa and you know Mist i’m so happy that the boyfriend girlfriend ridiculusity isn’t anywhere near us and even this husband wife stuff all wordplays we know who we are and our relation and thus no objects or ideas interfare...so eternalized,the end...(Misty smiles )..anyhow,and i knew you'll
get so much better overnight once you were with me again all the time.."
Misty(smile) : "You broke in and all,and i had a mixed
feeling,i didn't want to do anything,just sat on your Lap
and that was my moment still.."
Ash(smile) : "you sat so sweetly as i said barely managed not to hug you to death(Misty smiles and huggs Ash) Kanto Water Empress,most beautiful and
skillful Sensational Sister...Ash Ketchum,the little boy
from Pallet,always there..(hugging Misty very firmly)first sight ‘my Ash’ that’s it,that’s my sweet soulmate Mist(Ash and Misty both keep hugging each other firmly)..and no Mist,i was extremely
sorry to know your state...very sorry..and your doses of (),
that just turned me into a complete devil..that day i
preyed upon my sweety to soul her(both giggle).. truely i
was in an extreme mood of verbal smackdown cause that was the dose for the m.. that were trying to delude you in your mind..i really had to warn the Lab staff off though they weren’t legally authorized there once i was in but i don’t know what i did to you and your condition none would’ve understood me and would’ve jumped and if they did i would’ve felt physically threatened and that would’ve been it cause you know my most sinister ones were there all together and if Crwadauntogator themselves got a hint,they being who they are,that lab wouldn’t have been anymore...(Misty tenders Ash’s cheeks and hair)..really Mist,my whole wrath was upon the veil that covered you and any distraction would’ve just imploded me,i told you about the gym and all and i really did feel then and there that like just beat it i’ll kill off all gyms from this world and then when i was saying die.die,die that was even more crazy..really only my soumate could’ve faced that and ‘my Ash’ would become ‘I’m Ash’(both smile at each other and hugs each other)...but i just thank God that i've got
you back cause there were just so many constraints and chances...i'm rather now realizing even more after i've got
you back both our pains,mine especially... that's why I just
want to be with you in Honeymoon..all i want..just gazing
at you, hugging you,being at your presence..i just want my soulmate and adore
her all day.. you're my whole being Mist..i cherish you
too,soully so much..just you"(both hug each other firmly for some time)
Misty(smile) : "anyway as i’ve souled my sweet bee,lets go to mount moon 2 sweety"
Ash(smile) : "right,then those dumbnuts pulled their trick
and you mentored max and was separated with Pikachu
from us when i was thinking about Pikachu and Brock
suddenly said don't worry Misty is with them,which just
gave me a shock cause(laugh,Misty Laughs)yeah right,it
would've been a worry for us 2 years back that Pikachu was the one who had to look after yourself in such
situation but,then i realized (smile) that my flower had
really blossomed"
Misty(smile) : "i can never forget that dance and strangely
you were keeping May in between us"
Ash(smile) : "to gaze at you safely"
Misty(smile) : "so finally you decided to gaze at someone
intentionally"
Ash(smile,huggig Misty) : "not someone but my only flower..(Misty giggles)..yeah,and Mist certain b..(Misty Frowns)..
(laugh)..nah that's from undercover actually,comes
in Pinkeenberry(grin,Misty shakes her head and laughs,smile) anyhow
they have at first sight charmed me but gazing to me is all
about you(smile)...it was not how you looked or
anything..but i just loved to keep gazing at your face rather to say your whole being enticed me since the first sight,just my Mist...it's
majestic feeling(hugs Misty firmly,Misty too hugs Ash)"
Misty(smile) : "but,Ash try to cut that language,i know you're
feeling guilty about your actions to me yesterday and all
that,but please we're married now, it's ok..and it's ok,we
will be at Pinkenberry all alone for a long time.."
Ash(smile) : "right,so i gazed at you and obviously May
would understand and(laugh)threatened me to break my
head with stones at night unless i proposed,to which i
said she'll as usual eat too much and fall asleep,to which
she compelled Brock to ration my food and her "normal"food between poor Max and himself and scowled them to
gulp that up(both laughs) 10 years yet so very fresh in my
memory..(both smile)..so she starved herself and me,to
which i smirked that now great we'll eat each other
up,then she smirked that she'll be the best for both,then i
said if you slept off,she wisely nodded girls are always
more tensed(both laugh),when i said i've seen that,she frowned and
again then really said something i wish(sigh) i paid more
attention to..but anyway,i've my flower(smiles at
Misty,Misty giggles) she said that if i don't then even if
another boy doesn't or you yourself don't it'll only pain us
both,then i thought she won't let me sleep tonight plus
you were anyhow leaving as Daisy and gang were upto
their old dirty tricks(both laugh)..but again i now realize their trouble too,’you’re the reason for all this misfortune,sisters or show’(both brusts into laughter),what a night(both laughs)anyway,so i myself was also
desperate,did she tell you anything"
Misty(smile) : "she was here and there talking about Drew
as if to suggest me from my own experience,which she
was trying to portray as a travel companion
environment,and i easily realized what she was upto(both
laugh,Ash shakes his head) so i just played along,and yes
that day she implied to me that you want to meet,but i
also implied its always if other people aren't
evsdropping,which obviously dissapointed her(laugh) and
then we spoke(giggle)"
Ash(giggle) : "right,i just about didn't have the right words
and talked about your pokemons..well Gyarados that
is(Misty laughs)..and then we had that hand holding and
just slipped our fingers through againt each others
fingures and all that,and yet i just stammered along and then finally i kinda forcefully hugged you
and just said you're my best ever friend"
Misty(laugh) : "actually that really was your way of saying
you cherished me and i got that and answered you in your
language but didn't do much..i just wanted you to burn for
me with longing,as I thought then you'll have to confess
and i just loved that day so much"
Ash(smile) : "right,next morning May opined that it
would've been so much better if i did this and that,to
which i said next time i'll take the rose from Drew
personally,which dissuaded her from pestering both you
and me(laugh)..but(laugh)..yesterday’s confession is nowhere worldly..(both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "really Ash,from yesterday’s perspective just every seriousness or emotion or whatever even in that moment just makes no sense at all,’i’ll admit 3 things and ask 1 question’,’please’,’can i add two more questions before’(both brusts into laughter)..’what now’,’can i namecall you’(both brusts into laughter)..then finally i said whatever and you confess then still(both laugh)..’so i’m marrying a namecalled’ (both brusts into laughter),’yes as usual you namecalled”(both brusts into laughter)  really Ash,that was something else none would realize outside what we were doing(both smile) anyway back to mount moon 2(both smile) and then Brock was you know as usual always wanted me to jump and since that day also started to give a piece
of his mind everyday to you"
Ash(sigh) : "yeah he did,Mist,but i still can't come.."
Misty(frown) : "again dear?"
Ash(smile) : "ok,ok,i won't (Misty smiles),yeah so after my
3rd frontier symbol,i just couldn't take it anymore and one
day just phoned you and spoke my mind too emotionally"
Misty(smile) : "right,but Ash,that was music to my years
cause i was only waiting for the inevitability,and then you
were so so sweet"
Ash(smile) : "right,and then well,May and all came to know and
all that till i won Battle Frontier and straight went to
Cerulian,Mist if only i knew those.."
Misty(laugh) : "no let them sleep for now,ok?"
Ash(smile) : "my conversations with you became more
and more intense but i being a jerk,it was either pokemon
or your gym battles that's all"
Misty(smile) : "Ash,you're so sweet and then were even
more as you were just about becoming a youth,it was
amusing for me,and i always knew how much you loved
my poses and winks.."
Ash(smile) : oh! i died for those winks Mist,really,and your
poses were as beautiful as ever,just that jovial self yours shined through and i felt like never stop gazing your pictures and it was heaven,and then that..um.."
Misty(smirk) : "want those(laugh)?"
Ash(smile) : "soully(both smile)..so your kisses were
actually a big trouble cause they caught me and all
that,infact Dawn nonchalantly told me to do the same to you with her
lipsticks(both brusts into laughter).."
Misty(laugh) : "May helped the letters right?"
Ash (laugh) : "pretty much that's why they became very strange (botg laughs)..but you know my thing never were those i just liked to just get lost at your presece and all else just those pictures and calls then were emotions and now i’m soully Mistyvious(both smile and hug each other firmly)"
Misty(smile) : "soully,no Ash your beat-downs yesterday also has broken all of those from my mind as well but (laugh)..thank God i didn’t have to see Dark Night: Library Bookself Version(both brusts into laughter)... but your pictures made my day though i
was so terribly busy then,just in the shows and so on,but
people pestered me as well then,which i did tell you but
you always in all your sweetness either didn't realize or
brushed them off and that really made my day cause i
realized the insignificance more"
Ash(smile) : "right,um..just a sideshow(Misty
Laughs),those Godforsaken brats if are still
around,beware,(closed eyes,smile)i feel hungry,very hungry(both laughs)...so
i went straight to Cerulian and the first thing happened
was LillieDevil(both laughed) "who are you?where are you
from?why are you not at Viridian?why your hair is like
this?which perfume do you use?",then suddenly Daisy
remembers me and goes like "aww,the Hoenn Champion
Ash right",i said i just won Battle Frontier,to Violet's utter
confusion as she has never heard of it(both laughs) then
Lillie tells them its just that sideshow(both laugh) and looks at me
carefully when i somehow manage to say may i meet
Misty, Daisy goes like what i mean by meeting, whether i
know her,if i'm a fan they have no time for me and so
on,then i finally had to call them by their names and
remind me who i was,then they wisely pointed out that
the meeting is not possible to which Violet scoffed them saying this is so romantic and so on(both laughs),in the meantime
someone told them they were needed and they reluctantly
told me to go to the guest room and you were out for that
day..before that Violet pointed out to be more romantic,i must throw that henius cap away first(both laughs).."
Misty: "yeah,i went to Viridian actually for show,came
back got a verbal smack for inviting my boyfriend without
telling them(both laugh) and so on,when i finally pointed
out your second Gym battle there and all that,did they
finally warm upto you"
Ash : "yeah and then they started to cajole me into the
battling for them..(both brusts into laughter) then i finally
could meet you and confess my feelings for you and all
that and um.."
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "had our first kiss..till
yesterday my favourite moment"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "yeah, though i kinda never
expected it but had to give in to my emotions and you
actually made the situation normal"
Misty(smile) : "right!Ash,now you can understand my
position.."
Ash(smile) : "yeah,it really made your 2 years
actually(both smile) then of course i went back home the
very next day went to Sinnoh cause Gary had some great
new pokemons(both laughs) and then you know we were talking everyday and our relationship became clear and normal and all that,which saved me too by-the-way(both brusts into laughter)..then that Sinnoh League win
happened and umm(solemn)..things started to change"
Misty(smile) : "later dear,i want to go back(both
laugh)..restart from your phone confession(both laugh)"
Ash(smile) : "yeah the 1st and 2nd symbol..well it was
heart-wrenching..Mist, I really never even thought that you
could ever long for someone else so i was sort of sure
that i'll see you sweet face beaming again amd again..so
first two was a bit strange,i just couldn't let go of your
memories and my chu-bro would tell me that,this is Misty-
showing your things all the time and i guess he only
realized i want to meet you..then after my 3rd and you
were talking..well i got too close to the screen(both
laughs)..and sorta could feel your presence.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah and i just kinda automatically
puckered my lips and it was a really romantic moment.."
Ash(smile) : "but then somehow i refrained from kissing
you(both laugh) through the screen (both laugh)..but i just
knew..my sweet sweet chu-bro said just like i did with him,i now also want to fondle Misty(both laugh)..so
anyway next day..um.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah,next day,i knew you just were unable
to take it anymore,so just mouthed off any challenger..
(laugh).. alright.."
Ash(laugh) : "right,those damn brats that were alive that day if comes around, Gangerized version Crawdauntogator is patiently
waiting(both brusts into laughter).. they're hungry,very
hungry(both brusts into laughter)...yeah so then?"
Misty(smile) : "then i was just overjoyed and all and you
finally called and was gibberishing(both laugh)..so i just
kinda told you how i was a bit tired and want to rest on
the table so that i could come very close to the screen(both
laugh)..
Ash(laugh) : "yeah,mystyvious(both laugh,Misty smirks and tenders Ash’s hair)..no just the gibberish first(both laughs)..i just had a field day(both laughs)..and while not with my bunch just saw you everywhere(both smile)..then i thought how to approach you cause you were like my own self(both smile)..then came up with the idea of Whirl Cup of all more to appease you cause you won(both brusts into laughter)..so was gibberishing like..”
Misty(laugh) : “the bits i remember ‘um..great match’ 500 times(both laughs),’you looked so bea..um..gracefull’ 5000 times(both laughs) and finally ‘your’re just um..i mean..such a..um..frie..um..special person to me’ like a million times(both brusts into laughter),then i just wanted to push you to destruction(laugh,giggle at Ash,Ash smiles at her)..”
Ash(smile) : “so as soon as you came near the screen i just felt like imploding(smile,Misty tenders Ash’s cheeks) so i just couldn't take that anymore and
said i cherished you for so long and went all
over..Mist,that really was a great feeling(both giggle).."
Misty(smile) : "yeah and i was also so happy i just
reciprocated and kissed the screen(both smile).."
Ash(Laugh) : "to which i said on the cheeks(both brusts
into laughter)...anyhow then i personally phoned you
most because of sweet talks(both laugh) which were obviously sweeter Gyarados talks(both brusts into laughter) and all..then Gary insinuated May and they found out you kissed
picture(smile)..i did preserve the kiss but then just
faded(both laugh)..then you sent another such then won
Battle Frontier only after that i really was established as a grown up person(both laughs)..May decided to part,Max went back to start his
journey..Brock as usual wasn't sure whether another was
due or not but i went straight to Cerulian for 7 days(both
laugh)..told mom Mist is now my girlfriend and i'll see her later many times but Mist herself told me she may have
to go away for a long time without contact(both brusts
into laughter).."
Misty(laugh) : "mom later told me,the first thing you said like ‘Hi Mom!
remember Misty, she's my girlfriend now’(both brusts into
laughter)..and mom was kinda taken aback(both
laughs)..but she knew it all along anyway(both smile).."
Ash(laugh) : “Professor Oak said all the problems that have had happened is due to the marriage i was talking about being due for 17 years(both brusts into laughter) and not happening exactly then(both laughs)..the whole world knew except so and so but no vulture could’ve done anything as i’m all mistyvious(hugs Misty firmly and Misty also hugs Ash firmly and keep staring into each other’s eyes for a few moments)..”
Misty(hugging Ash,smile) : “my sweet bee,return(both smile)”
Ash(smile) : "right then of course those 7 days,Ceruliam
Cape,the Dates(laugh)..both have had a good dose of it i
guess..(both laugh).."
Misty(laugh) : "i'll always remember,'would you go to a
date if i ask you now',No,why, you're a stranger,you date
only known people then’(both brusts into laughter).."
Ash(laugh) : "then your shows,the songs..well infact i
never knew why Violate was a gym leader anyway(both
brusts into laughter)..i knew Daisy,you told she was
always good i saw that one day..but it just never
interested her..and Lillie was never concentrated..Violet..
(laugh)..how many(both laugh)?"
Misty(laugh) : "thrice in whole life(both brusts into
laughter)..after i returned only once(both brusts into
laughter)..and you know she'd say 1 on 1,first hit,Mantine
return,here's your badge(both brusts into laughter)..never
even bothered to have a second(both brusts intolaughter).."
Ash : "yeah but in shows i knew what Violet was once in
her environment..but i only gazed at you(both
laughes)..and i could see what other people were
doing..and one man one day probably thought i was
rather gazing like i know you very well..hey man do you
know her,yeah second cousin(both brusts into
laughter)..so that was it..um..just a bit(Misty brusts into
laughter)..those forsaken brats if are around that ever
even looked at my flower,i'm starving (both brusts into
laughter)..but Mist i only later realized boys were ok i
know girls far more dangerous (both laughes)..cause they
just want to know everything about you so that they can
immitate and all..I saw 4 shows..final day finally sweet
sweet Trace is there(both brusts into laughter)..i knew the
brat knows not one thing except swimming like 10
hours(both brusts into laughter)..and you carried him
throughout and he just didn't know what to do(both
laughed)..Trace was out didn't know i was in audience so
when i say hi,he was like why are you not in any
leagues(both brusts into laughter)...so had fun then that
moment there..in full night total seclusion your space that
was..once i entered i knew you had Mistyvious ideas(both
brusts into laughter)..but then again(both brusts in laughter..”
Misty(smile) : "just wanted to kiss you for may be like 8
years(both laughs)..so just went off and once i went very
close you just asked 'Mist,um..may i..um..have a.."(both
brusts into laughter).."
Ash(laugh) : "yeah ,and you straight came in front of me
with your typical mistyvious wink and smile and i got totally dissolved(both smile at each other) and and we had our kiss,a very long one too(both brusts
into laughter)..more like 80 years (both laughs)..anyhow,i
though didn't feel awkward but just a bit puzzled because
i knew you like better than the back of my hands(both smiles at each other) and like never have
been in that position and situation (both laugh)..so a strange stuff..during our kiss all i thought
was how much i cherised you and all that..it was great,it
was great.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah..i kinda completely lost myself and
so many emotions and all.. yesterday when you were
going like spit and caugh(laugh)..i felt really sad.."
Ash(solemn) : "um..Mist,i did hurt you but we.."
Misty(smile) : "that was then Ash,long long ago,this is soully(both
smile)..and then..um..i felt kinda awkward cause i knew you like myself as well(both smile) and then just like was so overjoyed and all(both giggle at each other) and never really wanted to meet
you the next day but then you just hugged me(both
laugh)..and then we went to the pool had fun there,well i
tried to kiss you everytime i saw you(both laugh)..but you
said may be the first word of wisdom i ever heard from you(both
laugh).."sweetness turns bitter if tasted too much"(both brusts into laughter)..so desisted..and then you again went,and it was the same phonecalls,pictures and all.."
Ash(smile) : "well i hugged you the next day cause i thought as you were avoiding me(both laugh) as i might’ve done something very wrong(both brusts into laughter)..so just hugged you and then itself you were again just wanted to be all over(both laughs)..no Mist,i got you fully at that moment how devoted you were cause you knew i’d go away again for ages and all your gym leader etc things went away and i saw how sweet you are and all mine(tendering Misty’s cheeks,Misty smiles)..that self i want to see all the time soully(both hug each other firmly for a few moments)...the rest around the gym my department(both smile)...except(both brusts into laughter)..anyway then again had to depart for the next league,just went to Sinnoh,Brock went in,May
came to know about us by the end,Max obviously realized
2 years later(both laugh)..i told Brock minus the kiss(both
brusts into laughter)..he was happy just patted me..Trace
was so overjoyed said like why didn't you call me(both
brusts into laughter)..anyhow then I met Dawn..her first
question is like Hi!I'm Dawn,tell me about your girlfriend's
favourite perfume(both brusts into laughter)..she was she..but she
wasn't like May(both laughes)..much matured and
absolutely cocky(both laughs)..was a sweet little girl
really..and Brock was much changed then but he told me
that this will really be his last trip so just to learn the
basics cause i still had two more regions left..and really i
was so oblivious,by the end of battle frontier you told me
many times and to learn those so i did a little..but then Sinnoh
went on got 16 badges and two ribbons,well that always
bored me to hell(both brusts into laughter)..and Drew
would always go like,5 minutes break it up in 50
pats(both brusts into laughter)..and May said no only
5(both laughs) then Dawn finally reviewed it must be 27(both laughs)..Dawn coerced me saying it'll
help me..so just went along..it was a different experience and good one cause before that i had two shared with May,these two were mine only,kind of an experience..i guess Sinnoh finally made me a man in all senses..(both smile).."
Misty(smile,hugging Ash firmly) : "um,Ash.. detail all your journeys.."
Ash(giggle) : "at your service as ever(Misty giggles)..
15,May-17,April,Indigo
17,May-18,May,Orange
18,June-20,June,Jhoto
these were with my sweet sweet Mist flower(both giggle
and hug)..but(laugh)..there was Trace(both laughes)..i can never
forget that brat(both laugh)..i wish he atleast came once
more and especially when Dawn was around(both laugh) and Brock was there as well those three would’ve created a massacare there..(laugh)..i guess i should’ve dragged Trace there and do his works at gym(both laugh)...but i'll now pester him(both laughes) for the rest
of my life(both laughs)..and you know i unnecessarily wasted a month
in Jhoto(both laughs).."
Misty (smirk) : "too much flower(both brusts into
laughter)"
Ash(smile) : "yeah,just didn't want to be away from you at
all..and you were in heaven that 5 year patience
finally(both laughs).."
Misty(smile) : "i always knew you only ever looked at me
like that..never anyone else..but i just wasn't sure...
but(smile)..now soully souled(both smile and hug)"
Ash(smile) : "i know what my sweety wasn’t sure about(hugging Misty very firmly,Misty looks into Ash’s eyes smiling)..it was whether or not ‘my Ash was adoring me all the time’(smile,tenders Misty’s hair,Misty hugs Ash firmly,smiling)...
then back at the journey->
20,July-22,June,Hoenn,our reunion at 21,April..i had to live
without my sweety for 9 months..but i really became your
fan after that Mist(both smile)..that night i was always
with you,well Gyarados actually..(both brusts intolaughter).."
Misty(smile) : "could you have beaten my Gyarados in
Hoenn?"
Ash(smile) : "gyms no championships yes but from upto quarters only and only with distinct type advantage like Pikachu or Snorlax but Crawdaunt or Feraligator even then could’ve beaten her as well(both laugh) but Heracross no(both brusts into laughter)..the reunion day i myself would’ve been in pokemon centre for a week(both laugh)..only when i was in the quarters,you know that feeling of invincibility...but you know Mist,if you too were a trainer like me we would’ve tied throughout our career at all points creating a record(both smile) but i’ve very rarely faced Gyarados though throughout my whole career a few times in championships well Hoenn itself being one,surprize surprize(both laughs) then in Gyms Unova and Sinnoh may be 4 times but against Gyarados it was always you not me(both laughs) and you know that Sinnoh final and my problem with your Gyarados is exactly that(both laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : “chu-bro prefers the little sister(both laughs)”
Ash(smile) : “yeah but by then i had the initial form of Crawdanuntogator(both laughs)..Mist,i’m nothing to your knowledge on water types but those two pests are truely once only(both laughs)..”
Misty(smile) : "Ash,i'm a hall of fame myself but you really
have i mean.. it's just impossible to think what only just
those two can do and they are just so so common everywhere abadauntly found and they’ve fooled around with Team Rocket highest boss,it’s just impossible..it’s soulmate really.."
Ash(smile) : "yeah,just letting them be who they are but(laugh)try Goldy with them(both
brusts into laughter)..anyway then 
Batrle Frontier from 22,July-
23,December,Battle Frontier
then with my flower for a week
then 24,January-26,February,Sinnoh,that really made
me then Pokemon Master..well the normal one(both
brusts into laughter)”
Misty(smile) : "yeah you really got very matured during
Sinnoh and when you returned were the exact dream man for me(Ash laughs,Misty laughs a bit later),unintellectual that is(both brusts into laughter)..and i was very happy..i mean you really mastered the sweet talk then(both brusts into laughter)..about
Gyarados still(both brusts into laughter).."
Ash(smile) : "right!infact i should be ever grateful to Gyarados for doing the beau-talking(both brusts into laughter) that too for like 7 years(both brusts into laughter)..actually you know i never told anyone
about my first kiss myself and still hasn’t and later when
they pressed me i would always say why were they
interested at all and so on,Dawn was always very excited about us but never went into overdrive like May who well had reasons(both laughs),Dawn had her
own goals,Brock had changed quite a lot and we just
trodden along, your name absolutely skyrocketed just after i left for Sinnoh and was supreme and i was very
happy for you then"
Misty(smile) : "yeah,and you were my relief as well as i
could talk about pokemons with you all day which here
was hard to do unless Trace was present"
Ash(smile) : "right,(frwon) that dumb buff..(Misty frowns)..anyway...(smile)but you remember that final..by the way
Daisy never forgave me for never giving you a flower
bouquet though(both laughs)till the great discourse(both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(smile) : "Ash,your two gifts Battle Frontier Trophy
and Sinnoh League, Especially Sinnoh league,you know
saved me many times actually.."
Ash(sigh) : "Mist,really you too need time in Pinkenberry"
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "i'm having every bit of it Ash,
don't worry"
Ash(hugging Misty) "right!"
Misty(smile) : "those two were you know what set Men
out of Boys,especially that Pikachu vs All in Sinnoh,that
was the Pokemon Master"
Ash(hugging Misty) : "i guess Mist,i guess.but um..(Misty
again laughes)..(laugh) time for brat break(both
laughes)..those who pesterd my sweet little flower,i'm
famished (both brusts into laughter),please i beg of you,please come by 12 at night(both brusts into laughter)....well you know Mist,that was my life that after this many years you get a certificate or medal or Trophy so that really was the prize and i thought it would be nice(Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s cheeks,Ash smiles too)..the Orange as you know went to Professor Oak,Hoenn i gave to Brock obviously then those two,then Unova i didn’t give to anyone(hugging Misty firmly) thats all for my sweety to retake(both smile),Kalos had to go to Professor Kukui simply due to the undercover and all and Elite4 they give medals only so yeah,that really was my present(smile)..”
Misty(smile,hugging Ash firmly) : “my sweet sweet bee(Ash giggles)..but really Ash,nothing like Sinnoh discourse(both brusts into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah,i’ll remeber myself as well,kinda came off,wanna listen again(smile,Misty smiles and nods)->
Psychic has to see you,so agility
Fire has to stay calm with your antics,so irritate
Ground has to keep you grounded,so springboard
Dark will show you might,so feign weakness
Direct type disadvantage thinks you are a bully(Gyarados),so befriend..(Misty laughs)..well chu won’t do beau-monitoring(both brusts into laughter)..
Dragon would underestimate you,so startle
Ghost has to engage you to the plays(Ganger),so compete..this was hardest part cause chu had to play which he never liked unless friends or mutual friends and somehow managed only
Grass would try to finish you quickly,keep patience...this was hard as in this one chu was a quite tired trying to appease Ganger of all(both laugh)..but just after the very first attack i said if i don’t win this i’ll never become what i want to be in mental signals which he was catching by then just around his self discovery of power became very perceptive,so this statement makes sure he kept his patience and then that legendary thunder-chair the first time i saw it before only read and thus shouted then,thus the miracle completed with one of the most elusive and miraculous attack and that was a big thing...”
Misty(smile) : “How was your feeling now as a review that you had then?”
Ash(smile) : “well i realized many things that Final day and so on,Pikachu's powers and my
intuitive powers really did give me the breakthrough,that i
just knew what to do to win any match in any situation
against just about anyone,except Gyarados(both laughs)...i lost in Unova only once on a best of 3 gym challenge in the second hall of fame gym that i went to,this was the very first match..
but other things happened and then the breakup
and then team rocket came around,where i had to be very
carefull,and it also was a big thing cause it was life/death of many dependent upon you and your bunch and all about your nerves,but then i really didn't care,was in my
own mood,own oblivion and fortunately my skills in
battling did defeat team rocket juniors and then finally the great boss but well(both laughs)..that gave me the very basis of my current plane(both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(smile) : "yeah busting team rocket just about
8 months after our breakup and the way how it was done and all that was happening i
really also thought your head had spun just too much as you might’ve understood you don’t have any match and
all that, otherwise by the end of the 2nd month right upto
6th i thought of the reconciliation many times but but
never quite proceeded and you know all the rest.."
Ash(smile) : "well i only wish i wasn't such a dumb
buffoon as well,but you know i was and then i went to
Kalos,exactly where you should’ve been with me AWOL(both laughs) and by the end of it i knew i had no many match in
this world when it comes to battling... just after Unova i had
only one match but that too like match in the sense her best level against my then current level which was only to get better and the match was Laura,were almost 90 by
then and i met her in Sinnoh when i won the league there
and she instantly recognized my just blossoming levels and really blessed me much and she actually did tell me
that i'll surpass her just after the next league victory and anyone else ever that she knew..she just said
your Pikachu itself is a miracle..i did tell her about
you,which to my surprize she knew rather well via one of
her relatives from next generation having woked in
Cerulian recetly"
Misty : "yeah,you called her and introduced me to her
from the Gym,and i spoke with her only on that day and
she really was very kind"
Ash(smile) : "yeah,as you know a real legend in all
departments,and(hugging Misty) you'll be such very soon Mist."
Mist(smile) : "i want(hugs Ash)this only"
Ash(smile) : "have all the time,as usual(both giggle)then of course
i won Kalos like i did and i just knew now i don't have any
match at all and basically i knew it was formality before i
got into hall of fame and Elite 4 happened,after the very
first Elite4 with those brats and all,i knew i have become
once only very concretely and i won't be able to battle long..so just
oriented the group and somehoe finished(both laugh)..but
my personal problems just erupted as well anyhow all
things finally came to be settled forever yesterday,as i had
MY FLOWER(both hugging each other smile)"
Misty(smile) : "but i want to restart again(both smile)"
Ash(smile) : "anything all the time(both smile)..
so, i come back from Sinnoh now a 4 weeks break and
again 3 weeks at Cerulian (both brusts into laughter)..this
time none of those 3 were there but Sarah of all was
instructed (both laughes)..She comes are you a
challenger are you a vistior,are you the official observer(both
laugh)..and i said i'm a challenger..(laugh)..none is here
now come at 3:30(both brusts into laughter)...then i
showed my Sinnoh title..ah!your Ash Ketchum..and goes
all over..then she ofcourse realizes about me and you
called you,i challenged you(laugh)..and then went all over
in pool(both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "yeah,that Sinnoh title and before that that
discourse you were a real star too then..so i just asked
Sarah she says new trainer 4 badges,Hoenn,2nd
region(both laughes)..so then I go and there’s You(smile)..so
sweet..then the challenge,you go like i choose Ash(laugh)
and jump into the pool..really you scared me with that
dive(both).."
Ash(laugh) : "nah just seeing you adrenaline stuff(both
laugh)..then my sweety sweetly came with the typical gracefully sweet dive(Misty laughs) and had a very good very long
hug(both laughs) and all the fooling around(both hugs each other very firmly)..then(laugh)..again
someone comes new challenger and i just said tell them
Sinnoh League's new champion Ash Ketchum is here cause this is his quote “VERY OWN” cousin's gym(both brusts into laughter)..so for
that day the Gym is shut and quote “NONE WERE THERE”(both brusts into laughter..then we had so much fun and
all that..and that was the time i was telling you yesterday Mist,yeah i didn’t fully understand your antics(smile,Misty laughs) then were just your heart wrenching longing for me otherwise i would’ve got formally engaged then as well cause after that i could’ve travelled without a trouble and any moment come back via relation or take you there(both smile)..anyway still beautiful times..Brock of course decided to go to
become a Doctor,Trace was just about beeing around Daisy flower i saw(both
laughs)but still the bufoon took 5 more years(both brusts into laughter)..and so on..you really were on top of your fame
then..good times really..that time i actually thought i had
stayed enough and we kinda had an understanding.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah true..we sort of matured and you only
had 2 leagues left..we both were very happy..Ash,i never
realized how much danger we and you then took up,so
difficult isn't it 2 years and all those places.."
Ash(smile) : "true Mist very much,well in Kalos i hiked
barely cause there's more cities and all and i had my
different intentions there but Unova i went in
26,April-28,September..that really was my tuning
point...my skills were just it was every day a thousand
new things and then attention,i completed 30 Gyms
there and all that..Iris and Cilan barely kept up with
me..that was Iri’s third and she was pretty matured girl of 23/24 was a different relationship entirely and rather competed with me and could hold her own and all and as Cilan told me much later went to Hoenn next won then Orange which she couldn’t win but found her soulmate in Hoenn and now according to Cilan just wants to settle down(both smile)..then there was the devil Cilan(both laughs)..he was very nice and all that,but then of course eventually comes to know about you(both laughs) and goes all over(both laughs)..Iris’s very first Gym was Cerulian which means(both brusts into laughter)she’s no more sane(both laughs)..so Iris of course remembers you and just says congratulations and all,Cilan can’t believe it and asks me how the hell did i even get close to you(both laughs) to which i scoff that i’m a 4 league champion what does he expect(both laugh),but really you know Mist,that was my ego,i did joke and would do so again if i have to go back there but now it’ll be purely a joke then it had ego mixed with it in a very large quantity(both smile,Misty tenders Ash’s cheeks)..i still never told anybody naming you just said yes i’ve a girlfriend and that’s it but you know travel companions will eventually come to know..Cilan is a true admirer of yours and in my dark days always told me to keep the feet at on ground and not to leave you thinking i was a bigger star,thought actually that i got jealous of your name and then me being there wanted to compet(both smile)..anyhow then all attention and my everyday sudden realizations did create a mess and i just never knew what is what except when i was with my bunch(both smiles)..and i kinda just brushed you aside later cause i just thought what’s the matter Mist herself knows all about it and i’m anyhow going to return to her and had a plan actually to stay with you for 2 or 3 months(Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s hair) then may be more cause i was 3 years advanced than last age limit and just could travel to Kalos ages later but then backtracked cause didn’t want to let go of goal and all,then liked the show boating and parties where girls i saw would jump and when they crossed the line just told them i’ve a girldfriend and then scoffed if necessary that we’re extremely devoted to each other since day one of our relationship and atleast my devotion wont stop increasing(Misty smiles)which dissuaded the brats,then a few poses and all with my grwoing abilities,and you finally were fed up and all those m..(Misty sighs and shakes her head)(Grin)..undercover language(both laughs)..anyway all they did was to just moan that you’re not happy never telling me the real issue and i told them Mist says she doens’t want me to come back but she just is living her dream and i don’t want her to come here either breaking that we’re having a rough patch in professional lives but we know each other for more than 12 years it’s all chill and besides i’ll eventually be back and with only one region left i’ll stay there 3 months no trouble and all..but the great matured legends(Misty shakes her head) gets the thing totally upended as did Brock of all later when i told him all is cough and spit the venerable himself gets the meaning but suddenly wisdom dawns that that also then is my view of my flower of all,what an utmost buffoon(Misty shakes her head and laughs)...so these great legends says that their heart throb is infatuated but very sweet so i’m myself having my 12 year old infatuation broken now suddenly cheating yet am not worthy enough to know the real situation but suddenly underground sludges aren’t infatuated despite hanging around exactly like what that great b.. was doing to me in Kalos(Misty sighs and shakes her head).. and suddenly sludges are great venerable ones having the license to enter buildings where as if they were anticipating the break-up,what abject retardness is it to think if you’re not spitting at your girlfriend everytime your immature..(sternly,Misty tries to calm Ash down)...no Mist,it’s ok..i must for the sake of it,the legends themselves were infatuated with you and that’s why i never liked that responsibility stuff at all..anyhow..whatever..just spoiled the mood these f..”
Misty(hugging Ash very firmly,smile) : “sweety,you’re flower wants you now,come”
Ash(hugging Misty very firmly,angry) : “that’s why Pinkenberry and i won’t hear anything but neither me nor you will use phones if serious matter Orange Elite4 will be too glad to find us and inform us sooner than a wink,that’s my final say”
Misty(same pose) : “it’s all right dear,just calm down”
(Ash and Misty keeps hugging each other very firmly for a few minutes)
Ash : “anyhow,Unova,at first it was well then my head wasn't right then
our problems started and all that,you weren't in a good
place either,far worse than me..and that i really regret 30
is just a number you know..but anyway my flower is just
here(hugs Misty firmly,smiles,Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s cheeks)..by the end of Unova i was already in the hall of fame and thus was selected.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah you were great but then pressure
upon me was always increasing and you also weren't that
close it seemed always became about how great this
party was or what you could do..then may be for the first
time in like 8 years i screamed at you and you were rather
flustered and all..then i realized you came to and
agreement with press and all but just always seemed very
far..just profesaional life..and yeah i cheris you..and here
peole were constantly hanging around me and all
that..Trace was my only link with normalcy..and i'd always
tell him keep a tab on Ash,he's gonna get
bamboozled..and he did what he could do..Brock went so
busy..did meet me but was rather all into his own stuffs..i
just felt lonely..i realized then Ash,as you said yesterday..
truely i do need you so much.. it's just not fulfilled without
you.."
Ash : "yeah i just brushed aside your troubles and all..that
was being bufoon..and then we just came to that day
when i,Mist,i still regret that and that's what i was telling
you..i was killing myself as well..i just told you i'm busy i
dont wait for guys to come into the doorstep..just if i said
random people,it goes completely different place..and
you never cared but then these brats..domeone pestered you too much that day?"
Misty(smile) : "yeah,just a guy pestered me to much..and
then,but Ash(hugging Ash),just take your break(both
brusts into laughter)
Ash(laugh) : "those damn brats tried to talk with my sweet
flower,i'm salivating,the hunger and then the prey..please i
beg of you..just come around..i'll feraligate you(all brusts
into laughter)..how many times you used Glalie?"
Misty(smile) : "few times.. extremely good..but now
probably same i guess(laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "she's a lesser gem(both laugh) but still more
than any legendary pest if she wants to be(both
laughs)..her thing is that she'll say you look ugly,this will
check that etc(both laughs).."
Misty(laugh) : "far sane with me(both laughes)..yeah,i just
remembered your words as like till yesterday when you showed
me what you did,soulmate..and i just got angry..then that
day wasn't good..and i always thought about
reconciliation but just never knew and you went
undercover..so we just only had your those words and
all.."
Ash(hugging Misty firmly) : "no Mist what pains me most isn't that actually i didn't do what a friend should've done those words are total nonsense to me as i showed but the fact that what i intuitively knew then wasn't actualized and it took 4 years that's all and that's why Pinkenberry(smile,Misty hugs Ash firmly and smiles at him)"
Ash : "anyhow Mist,i must finish Unova,so i was winning badge after badge and all and with my every realizations and all i just never knew what is what and so behaving abnormally exactly your state after break-up,and so one day even told my sweet soulmate Mist of all that she was behaving like she was the only one in her position,that was a henius thing cause i wanted to say please Mist i cherish you as much but my head isn't alright at all so please don't get angry with me you still are my only one,but got it totally opposite.."

























Misty : "then as i was about to ride my in-you-words
"godforsaken" bike,i just turned around to have a last look
at you.."
Ash(hugging Misty) : "just for clarification,Mist,that song
you were humming that day from Kelly Trooper's
Rockmore Woods-"Cutain Call",which we jointly roasted(both laugh) to soul it up(both smile), 
that um..if i weren't an
utter buffoon then,i would've instantly atleast have a
private talk with you or well..um..i've never thought itself
but why I didn't go to Cerulian myself that day?i barely
knew there was something called Hoenn in this world.."
Misty(smirk) : "parting with each other actually broadened
both our gazes, don't you think?"
Ash(irritated) : "whatever!i just want to fondle my flower
all the time(smile,Misty giggles)..but the next one year if
any vulture and especially the Cerulian breed tries to
insinuate that i must stay away My wife for a full 12 hours
due to some godforsaken work,then i'll.."
Misty(brust into laughter) : "Ash,i would've been in a big
trouble had you infact tried to come with me that day
cause we were 17 and that though was a Gym still my
home also..plas(giggle)..that bike ONLY had ONE
seat(laughing),else it would've been another night outside
and um..you know you might've been.."
Ash(giggle) : "endangered?"Misty(laugh) : "exactly"
Ash : "i've always wondered to which Cerulian bonehead
did this idea occur to not give an extra seat in the bike so
that people may carry others yet gave a god damn basket
in front which was oversized and made the control
almost impossible that too in a godforbidden forest like
Viridian,which i guess i still may get lost in(laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "Master in Cerulian Hating should be your
title you know"
Ash(scowl) : "i never found anything good there EXCEPT
my most cherished flower(hugging Misty,Misty
giggles),and my badge too was due to her"
Misty(smile) : "well,atleast we battled,Dase really made a
mess out of the situation"
Ash(laugh) : "never saw anything like before or after..
Sensational Trio in all aspects,no they have no match,still"
Misty(smile) : "Voil would be in Cerulian the very next day
i never knew"
Ash (laugh) : "all she did was to panick all over the place
long enough to force the police to start interrogating till
Lance forbade them.have you called Violet?"
Misty(smile) : "yes,she was the first one to see the
judgement day death note you rather shoved through my"
earsAsh(grim) : "um..was i too..um..loud?"
Misty(laugh) : "Ash,your another gem like my sisters,that
day's theatrics as i later heard were brilliant,if you were in
our show at your present form,we would have had to turn
the building into showhouse only cause even 4 of us
wouldn't have had any time to manage the pokmeons let
alone the Gym Battles but as soon as you would've
realized that your Cerulian-Vultures were going to your
Insinuate something,we would've been driven out of the
city itself"
Ash(laugh) : "i guess"
Misty : "i turned back and saw Brock returning and you
had your head down murmuring something..
Ash : "um..i was going to part with you three after 5
years,well Brock left,Tracy left but that day you..you never
went away from me even for a moment Mist in all those 5
years,you didn't even go home,rather staying with me only
with phone contact i remembered that Daisy and all
weren't then exactly showing there care to you so you
were rather happy with me and when i returned home
after 3 years,you stayed in my home infact for all those 3
days(laugh) that was too much for my break.."
Misty(laugh) : "sure,how many days did you halt
afterwards?"Ash(smile) : "you and Brock- your memory was troubling
me after Jhoto and as soon as i went home,next day
heard Hoenn,next day out,2 nights,Hoenn to Battle
Frontier,6 nights and you were there,May was beaking my
head whole day since she saw me alone with you in the
balcony..and um..you then had already reached a pretty
high level for a 19 year old,and i saw you suddenly just
after getting inside home and was then an utter jerk to
say in reply to you ever sweet greeting "hi Ash!" I said
rather in a flustered state "yeah! Hi! what are you doing
you?" and you came to congratulate me on my Hoenn
victory"
Misty(laugh) : "you were so childish even at 19,but i just
cherished that sweetness of yours ever so much"
Ash : "yeah as i said that,you just smirked rather as you
expected something like that by then and congratulated
me..but,you'll forever be a miracle monger to me sisnce
that day our reunion in Hoenn,i saw Gyarados and then
the flamethrower,i was rather so jealous of you as i
thought i want Gyarados and also more so cause i had
very few pokemon as i was new to hoenn,but then..
(blush)..um..i turned back at you and you were smirking
at me saying that it was rather very impressive than only
impressive with a rather proud face then i went intoflashback and recalled,and i'm naratting this to you now
cause i was too flustered before to do so but you looked
nice that day,i already felt a strange feeling that since very
last days of Jhoto was being more apparent to me but i
never quite bothered.."
Misty(smile) : "you were thinking a too much about me
and gazing at me a bit too much and a bit longer and a bit
more intently by the end of Jhoto,i was in cloud 9 and
Brock also told me but you know what he was then to just
as usual jump into the sea(laugh).."
Ash(smile) : "yeah i guess i never before that considered
you as a great playmate,but as i said,as you were looking
at Gyarados i looked at you constantly and intently a bit
and then followed you after that closely,how you took the
pokeball,kissed it as if you knew you would win,which i
never till then myself could do so confidently,and released
Gyarados of all pokemons..i really was amused,just how
self confident you were,and Mist,it was the i realized
jealousy but as later i returned from flashback i thought
may be i could beat Gyarados too but your disposition did
entice me..when in Hoenn during the reunion i was just
overjoyed to be able to see you and so did you.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah,during my 5 years i was all about
following you,fighting you and longing for you,the Gym suddenly such a huge responsibility and your memories
just made had in those mere 9 months turned me into
a grown up lady"
Ash(smile) : "exactly, that's what i did saw,i saw the
Cerulian City Gym Leader Misty Waterflower not my
playmate Mist anymore(Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s hair)..no Mist,you know what as sweet as you are,i just still cherish your that cute little sweetness that you were when we first met and the reason is simply because that dumb Gym..i never felt you had the time to enjoy yourself more which i had in Hoenn after which i got a better foothold on things,but for me i just feel your pain now Mist..you know great Gym leader is one thing and my sweet Mist is another,now i realize that sudden maturity of yours didn’t do you much favour as dumb buffoons instantly jumped upon you..if you got that Hoenn or may be another year atleast in fact you could’ve become what i’m now,always fooling around,everfree,totally careless,totally free from anything-this Mist is your real nature as now as know.(Misty smiles,tendering Ash’s cheeks).you know Mist,i’ve had my respect and i’ve had my reservations for all in this world of Pokemon professionally involved and even for team rocket..but now i just feel that all is a bondage to me atleast for sure this idea of responsibility in this profession regarding this exact word pokemon battle(Misty smiles)..i can just laugh at anyone saying responsibility that they feel cause i know by soul no such thing exists...you want to be a gym leader you should be but i just don’t like this idea of responsibility at all and i want to take that upon myself cause battling for me is done for this life,i’ve got nothing to do except to fool around and that’s how i’ll make responsibility a complete joke and fun that’s all..Mist,i just want you to get rid of this dumb idea of responsibility for a f.. Gym,Pokemons,your family different stuff,but this Gym that hasn’t ever done you a good and had almost killed you by slow poisoning which another dumb buffon like me didn’t realize then due to utter ignorance..just don’t bother about dumbnuts trying to win badges,Mist you know me,i wouldn’t care a fig if a gym is closed for that day,i’ll move along to next and so on,these brats should realize that a badge has to earned and not just you can arrive and it’ll be handed over to you after may be your first 3 gyms,Brock did hand it over but i wouldn’t have stopped if he didn’t,i wouldn’t have stopped if Daisy had beaten me that day rather than just giving me the badge away..that’s what i want if anything to see in people who wants to do Pokemon Training..one has to move forward and that’s all otherwise why bother coming here at all..and no Mist,no matter what you say,as long as i’m in Cerulian,no brat gets to challege unless they know how to behave properly and give right respect no matter what he or she thinks inside...to me it’s all about your bunch and that’s how it should be no matter where and every hall of fame gym that i’ve seen was exactly like that except this damn Cerulian..but every Gym must be like that in my ideal picture,what responsibility does a gym leader has to babysit a buffon who doesn’t know what he’s doing in the first place?..the answer is absolutely none,and that’s how it should be...i just want this Mist that’s all,nothing else,just don’t think you have any responsibility to anyone if they are incompetent enough to not behave properly,just let me drive them away,they’ve got a long way to go to become a sane person first and then handle their own bunch then think of training then set a goal gym is the last step,if one can’t do that,atleast Cerulian isn’t for them as long as i have to see them day after day and see my sweet flower getting drained day after day..4 on 4 no restrictions,battle or bust..you’ll understand the challengers capasity after the first round itself you don’t have to go till 4th being a Gym leader,but the pests will think twice on a four on four strict stuff..those brats uttering attack this and that..just fed up with it am I completely and it’s so much fun if the two really are respectful to each other,barely found it..finally my thing is that just don’t think that it’s your responsibility to babysit doomsday goblins out of their infatuated slumbers..they will get their food thrown somewhere else,my sweet flower’s sweetness would be cheated upon i won’t tolerate that if i’m in the gym and as soon as you went back buffons started to roam around and it was those 4 dumb buffons to come first will not be sane for long(Misty laughs and shakes her head),i just don’t like it at all this idea of responsibility of a gym leader just totally bogus stuff anybody experienced enough knows who deserves what..if the brats don’t understand that’s their retardness not the gym leader’s irresponsibility straight and simple..."
Misty(smile,hugging Ash firmly) : “my sweet little bee,you’re always within me dont worry(Ash smiles and hugs Misty very yfirmly).everybody isn’t you Ash,just give them a chance,what you could do with any gym which i myself saw i know,very rare people can do that and in Kalos atleast you had long surpassed anything imaginable here,you never had any match and yes Brock did tell you many times that Onix wouldn’t have coped up with chu-bro if you just persisted a bit and i get your point and who you ever were but your likes are rare and yes you’re right that the responsibility stuff did get on my nerves but it’s ok,i just ever needed my soulmate that’s all,i’ve in my 12 years barely saw anyone like you except once or twice..though(laugh)..i can already understand what doom awaits even if the Elite4 heads come in there once my fool-around bee steps in(both laugh) with Crawdauntogator(both brusts into laughter)..but just be patient Ash,you’ll have ample time to be with me sweety,don’t worry and alright i myself would love to battle good challengers be it less in number but still atleast say 2 days are for kids,agree?”
Ash(smile,hugging Misty firmly) : “soully...but only a half day(Misty brusts into laughter)and the registration time will be 11-11:15(Misty brusts into laughter)..at Dark Night:Gym Challenger Registration Version(Misty laughs aloud)..if pass that get you badge but unfortunately no legend would dare to play this one(Misty laughs)..just want to chew up each brat that ever cheated on my flowers sweetness and those who will..besides if any pokebrat misbehaves(Misty brusts into laughter),you have apart from my water pests you have an electrician there(both brusts into laughter)..that’s enough...my sweet Mist shouldn’t be away from me long at all(both smiles at each other)..(laugh)..besides Mist,i’m already dreaded enough am not I that you’re AWOL(both brusts into laughter)..”
Misty(smile,tendering Ash’s cheeks) : “soully(both brusts into laughter)..i won’t be away from my bee either(both hugs each other firmly for a few moments)..”
Ash(laughs) : “besides can i bash Cerulian again?(both laughs)”
Misty(laugh) : "Ash,give it a break,we’ll see when we get in,now continue"
Ash(smile) : "right no Cerulian bonehead could disturb me
when i was looking at you,the Gym Leader,then i saw you
had become so established in yourself and my first
jealousy turned into the respect for that i had for a Gym
Leader..(laugh)till i started trash talking them last year.."
Misty(smile) : "but you still have.."
Ash(smile) : "precisely.then i had that respect for you,then
i was rather ashtonished by you and kept a bit more
regular contact because may be um.."
Misty(smile) : "felt insecured with yousrself?"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "i always am unless you're
right here"
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "right!you know for all my
infatuation with you Ash,that reunion i saw you,you also
had grown up but were in same sweet oblivion that i
rather felt a big sister affection for you rather than an
attraction,but i always had my feeling inside me and yourt houghts,it really was a great reunion,but by then
affection had taken over attraction whenever i thought of
you,and um..Ash,a few times then i've had my doubts
whether mine was also a mistake i mean whether it was
true feeling or only infatuation for you.."
Ash(smile) : "Mist, it's just the process till the final union
that we've had where you saw all objects and ideas were absolutely laughed off and we’ve got souled as usual."
Misty(broad smile,hugging Ash) : "exactly".
Ash(smile) : "then i kept up contacts with you which is after Jhoto i contacted you twice in weekends and once in midweek it became 2-2 cause of my journeys but the extra day was for Gyarados(both brusts into laughter)..”
Misty(laugh) : “What did you do to my poor girl yesterday Ash,hum?(both laughs)..”
Ash(laughs) : “well Gyarados being Gyarados ever angry gets ready out comes Heracross with total type disadvantage and also to fool around with my sweety(Misty smirks,Ash tenders her cheeks,Misty hugs Ash firmly) then Heracross said like ‘me 4 legal 2 illegal beaus(both laughs),you one legal and no illegal beaus,match done’(both brusts into laughter)..yeah exactly why she was so puzzled as you know the that bug just played a sentimental type difference nasty joke(both laughs) cause recently the Lab has had a few Gyarados’ and the bug as usual bugged around and extracted this info as to her it’s called beau-counting(both brusts into laughter) and their different antics and so on and her illegal ones are Bulbasaur(both laugh) and Bruneri(both laughs)..the poor girl looked at you and just lied down thinking what world is this even(both brusts into laughter),then i just went and patted her and said like don’t worry al all and she kinda was relieved to get back into the ball rather than being with absolute madcaps(both laughs)..and Mist had i told Nivy(both laugh)..it would’ve been like ‘do you interpret better your masters moods or emotions’(both brusts into laughter)..Gyarados would’ve cried there then...once the opponent for once thinks of anything else apart from just fooling around,my bunch can’t be beaten and the otherwise is that the match doesn’t happen,so always a tie(both smile)..(laugh)..though Mist,except Goldy i guess all are well behaved so don’t ever let your Gyarados to mingle with those two water brats(both laugh)..she’ll make all challenger’s her beaus then(both brusts into laughter)...”
Misty(laughs) : “we should just let them have fun and just give the badges away then(both laughs)..”
Ash(laughs) : “yup,Dark Cerulian Gym:DaisyDevil version(both laughs)...just love that name on poor Daisy(both laughs) but the night has been stupendous just because of that mob..what a night this comrads Cerulian/we must very first get rid of this evil king demon/he gets to a shop as if to get his due/suddenly he declares a ring for his beau(both brusts into laughter)...no Mist never can forget that mob in this life...’you’ve abducted all’,’why would they want Cerulian rings’(both brusts into laughter)”
Misty(laugh) : “Ash,would you finish reminiscensing want some sweet bee buzz(both laughs)”
Ash(smile,huggig Misty firmly) : “right sweety,so then the contacts were more frequent and
always were fun but rather grave and serious
discussion,but then you should tell me about the
handkerchief"
Misty(smile,tendering Ash’s cheeks) : "still has it?"
Ash(dissapointed) : "no,torn it up myself..um.."
Misty(smile) : "didn't spare a single one did you?"
Ash(dissapointed) : "all went the first night itself"
Misty(smile) : "you've always been like this haven't you"
Ash(solemn) : "i guess, don't like to keep junk rather
everything in memory"
Misty(smile,hugging Ash) : "just store this one specially."
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "done."
Misty(smile) : "right,then as you were murmuring and
Brock was approaching you,i finally tried to atleast give
you an ultimate point,then gave you my handkerchief andlater sent you the lure.."
Ash(laugh) : "well the handkerchief helped the very next
day as those 3 buffoons jumped on me.."
Misty(smile) : "thank God they did,else you wouldn't ever
had thought about Keeping it"
Ash(smile) : "might be,but anyway then i kept that with
me.then it just went on,would have a look at it and all..i
didn't miss you i've never missed anyone nor i will but i
guess it was just my longing for you that's all.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah,and the other breaks?"
Ash(smile) : "Sinnoh 1 night(laugh) after i returned from
Cerulian,Unova was 14 nights,then I was in a totally
different domain,break-up,went undercover,came back
again Kalos..Kalos has been my best journey personally
but just that last moment has made it sour..i had
enoumous privacy and i was somewhere else really in
Kalos cause i never needed to think about battle and all total self reflection for around 2 years amusing experience for me that..won all the Badges from hall of fame leaders at full force..know the whole region so
well..and then Elite4..um,it was the point i just wasn't
really sane after that farewell incident in Kalos and then the sludge attack at Unova and that was my ultimate point as i told you after that i just became nasty on any kind of personal relationship,then i
planned,August,October,December,January,March,April,June
that was my plan
Unova,Sinnoh,Hoenn,Kalos,Jhoto,Orange,Kanto...well i
hated to go back to Orange cause you were 17-18
then,with all your blossoming jubilance(Misty laughs) and Trace with his antics(both laugh)..14 years,and I just didn't want to
mingle much..but you know i just knew who i was then..it
just felt like i could turn the whole world over just for
fun..but i really didn't have any objectives..just thought
buy a library in Kalos and spend the rest of my library or
go to Sinnoh and Professor Kukui..and all,then finally
went into Kanto..Lance said what he said..still I went back
to Kalos to have a study further..then once i finished
things actually pained me so much,each time i parted
from you came back and i just became a devil..i realized
my Mistake but more so my longing was now tangible to me which just surpassed all emotions..and had a feeling that you weren't married or
like that,but if you really were..i'm sorry Mist,but i just
might've destroyed the whole Cerulian city and abducted
you or something..i just didn't know what i was doing and
with my level it was hard..Pikachu realized this and he
became very agitated all the time..but as luck may have
it..you were in that condition..and i just jumped upon you
that's all..there was no power that day Mist, Could've
taken you away from me..i'm so sorry i pained you for 12
years being an idiot..i just can't be whole without my
Mist.."
Misty(smile) : "forgetting whom your naratting the story
to,dear?"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "all of memories are so precious to me now only because i'm naratting them to
my sweety!"
Misty(smile) : "ok,lets continue!"
Ash : "yeah,then that Jhoto separation..i was going a bit
poetic about Brock but could only say thank you Misty to
myself as your thoughts were choking me and the more it
went the more i realized what you meant when you said
"would i ever see you" and that song,i just brushed you
aside being childish as it takes if i sat on Charizard then 20
minutes to reach Cerulian,now 3(laughs,Misty sighs and shakes her head,but as soon as you were gone i
just couldn't come into terms you know 5 years not one moment we were away...then team rocket came
then i realized your words and kept that handkerchief
went to phone you from the Lab..on the road i once or
twice said "hey Misty,come look its this or that pokemon"
(Misty smiles) only for chu-bro to remind me that you
weren't there anymore,which after 5 years of constant
company was just too much to take(tears).."
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "sweety,I'm here always"
Ash(clears off tears,smile) : "we grew up with each other
didn't we Mist?"
Misty(smile) : "surely Ash,i myself can't believe it either
that for 5 years not even a day was spent without you"
Ash(smile) : "that got you through in your initial days in
that go..nah just not in a mood.."
Misty(laugh) : "finally the poor Cerulian brats can sleep
well(Ash laughs)(smile) yeah,and you've influenced my
style as well the most though later i found mine"
Ash(smile) : "you and Gyarados have influenced me beyond
measures"
Misty(laugh) : "till that day.."
Ash(smile) : "no,still..(laugh)..well  beau-counting is different plane(both brusts into laughter).."
Misty(laughing) : "you don't need anything anymore"
Ash(smile) : "except you that i have"
Misty(smile) : "right"
Ash : "yeah,well all has been influenced by my style till i started Dark Night:Tickle Tracy Version(both laughs)...but nah your style has a different grace,i was all about intuitive counters and all,you were ever forward yet gracefull and just as i said were so much more powerful than what you showed always so self confident and your abilities,you were eversweet everywhere and my true dream everywhere(both smile at each other) and my Mist is ever dream esque to me never touched by this world of words and ideas..way above my soul my being Mist you’re just me(both hug each other firmly)...all i ever want is to be in the dream to see the dearm that you are,just keep gazing at you for eternity,feel your presence perpetually just my Mist is how i call it(both keep hugging each other very firmly for a few moments)...”
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly) : “Ash,just you”(they keep hugging each other firmly for a few more moments)
Ash(laugh) : “but here about your style i’m using you in past tense cause you know the electricity(both brusts into laughter)..no really Mist you’ll have to change your style pretty drastically cause i have to have him due to my stuffs and that pest is really dangerous(Misty laughs and shakes her head)..unless you really you know play with him and let your bunch play with him,he’ll mid match try to fondle with eveyone cause that to him would signal that this is play(both laugh) and thus all of us would have to be aware of light going out anytime and sudden appearences with tickling(both laughs)...anyhow,then obviously i won Hoenn which kinda made me feel that i really can go the way cause it was my second and i got serious,came to know the rules very well and all that and kept contact with you
but as i was saying you said congratulations while at home and i looked
at you and i just knew you were so much more powerful
than what you showed and i really became a fan and was
kinda.."
Misty(laugh) : "following me around in your own home(both laughs)"
Ash(smile) : “well as i said either me or you physically will do that anyway(both smiles)..yeah,and that little brat picked it it up as i probably
that day had let my arms around you shoulder or
something while star gazing and that was 2 days before
we departed"
Misty : "i was just loving it,i told you i had a strange big
sister affection for you then,but actually it was longing
and i just wanted you to try to fly around me just as i did
for all those years..(giggle) "
Ash(smile) : "and i happily obliged,but(grim)and these m.. didn’t realize that the maturity was too sudden and thus would create mental pressure eventually especially cause she was living and feeding utter buffoons which was the reason why she had to be like a big sister to all otherwise she couldn’t live there in that nonsense mess,and i heard that she was the great queen while the reporters had ulterior motives cause they were abject boneheads..”
Misty(sigh) : “Ash,it was 12 years ago,just beat it”
Ash(laugh) : “can i cheat on Cerulian Mist?”
Misty(frown) : “you..(brusts into laughter)..Ash..”
Ash(hugging Misty very firmly,smile) : “every day selected challengers,natural environment,Charizard will be there,a totally new type of facility,so?why not sweety..hum?..”
Misty(tendering Ash’s hair) : “you’ll be bored cause no vultures will be there(both laughs)”
Ash(looking into Misty’s eyes,hugging her,Misty also hugs Ash and looks into his eyes) : “that’s not the answer and it’s so sweet this idea,hum?..lets runaway?”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “Ash,just..”
Ash(smile,same pose) : “soully”
(they stay in that pose for few momemts)
Ash(smile): “had the right thing,that’s the system”
Misty(smile,looking into Ash’s eyes,hugging him,Ash also hugs Misty and looks into her eyes) : “lets just runaway”
Ash(smile) : “Pinkenberry all day long,just you and me soully together(both keeps the same pose for a moment and then hug each other very firmly for a few more moments)”
Misty(smile) : “alright continue running away(both smile)”
Ash(smile) : “yeah,so May was so
ecstatic and saying propose,propose,propose(Misty
laughs) the whole day next day to which i scoffed her that
she was a mere kid then,to which she scowled and said
she'll keep an watch on me,to which i said till Drew comes
around,at which she just frowned and left telling me if i
don't propose i'll be in deep waters(laugh)"
Misty(bit concerned) : "Ash,May is the best friend,your true little sister
you've ever had,why cut her off?"
Ash(solemn) : "Mist,i just sweared her left and right thats
all,she said-well it was her 1st anniversary with
Drew,actually on phone..um..i regret that really but i..that
was the very next day Serena pulled that b.. stunt which obviously for a(Mist frowns again and shakes her head)..anyway.. and i
already had turned Max off so,um..as soon as her
thoughts appeared and i realized i had always taken
Serena as that as well and she cheating on my trust,i just
couldn't contain myself..and she was the only person that
i never spoken harshly,she was exactly my little sis and
among all if later I trusted someone it was her,became
very vey matured after her Jhoto league and all of you
know her and Drew..both just utterly sweet..i did use harsh
words,which i did to all else including you many times but
not May and Max,well Max was so little then but May,you
just can't be harsh on her,Max I showed my disinterest and he himself took the clue and was off without telling May at all,just like Clemont and Dawn,Cilan was well
he was professional with me thoroughly...well May on her
anniversary said like i couldn't have imagined a better day
and you know better day and i was there,she since she
partes always called me bro or something..and all that i
just lost it..I said get off you being with him and breaking
up makes no sense to me or you,you say its better day as
if it was a big deal and you wouldn't have someone other
than Drew and viseversa..that was a real crime from
me..and she just realized i wasn't on level head cause of
all my things and all that then..but May was the only one
who sympathized with me after our break-up..Drew was
kinda not sure..but May surely..Cilan chided me straight
but said i won't bother about your personal life as he saw
my full change and you and me from so sweet to so
sour,and he is your huge fan..i perfected cooking and all
from him as Brock left..so he has been Professional and
never contacted you i guess since once just after break
up till today?
Misty(bit long faced) : "No he didn't.. just the day after you told him,was
very brief just wished me luck and just how happy he was
to personally know me and all that was it..May kept
contact and was same as she was except any mention of you unless logically impossible,Max was always my huge pet(Ash laughs)..he kept contact,Dawn very rare..later didn't at all but
surprisingly was around Cerulian the day after your antics(Ash
laughs),I threw the party,she was there the next day,told
me heard about it from Pokémon centre and all..was nice
and then you know said i will contact you cause I can't
keep my emotions checked when its about you and all
that(both laugh)...Iris never did contact me afterwards as you said in your case just wanted to move on and
Max recently turned off the last 9/10 months or so,realized
my moods and that was it.."
Ash(bit concerned) : "Mist,just a thing,those stuffs..why
suddenly.."
Misty(sigh) : "just an addiction you know..you were
haunting me and even in the very last days i didn't want to
battle and all..and then started it after the sludge attack and then Dase much later found out,just had a quarrel and then just went a step too far,this made Dase actually scream at mom once mom may have said something about you and so on..you really saved me Ash..no you said that
day you know you're an insane and all sucked up
nothing(Ash hugging Misty firmly)..i would've become exactly that cause..i just
didn't know and every night that picture i thought i'll tear
apart but just couldn't..someone i talked with and even agreed to date,but just that moment at night when i thought about it i just felt like a sword has just pierced through my heart and just hugged that picture cried my head off and would say like leave me and all..i told you just an overdose and i'll
call all to jump..5 months i would've done that,i
would've become completely lunatic..but(beam),then my
sweet bee came and just..(hugging Ash firmly)..I cherish
you so much Ash..so much..soully.."
Ash(hugging Misty firmly,smile) : "my sweetly sweet sweety flower...you know Mist,this exactly was the factor that your very being was me and everyone that came to your personal contact knew it and my great legendary crime was that why i wasn’t exactly like in that aspect and thus i was deemed immature despite me telling those m.. things that helped them the most and that immaturity was what bugged those m.. yet they weren’t prudent enough to just knock me knowing i’m immature saying come back battle prove yourself only whinning like so and so..and them being the greatest legends in maturity were bufoon enough to not take up that damn gym for 10 days or just shut it down for 10 days and if that wasn’t good enough they let sludges float up the groud...just funny Mist,just funny as i said yesterday all about your not you..i never needed to prove anything to you and viseversa and you know Mist i’m so happy that the boyfriend girlfriend ridiculusity isn’t anywhere near us and even this husband wife stuff all wordplays we know who we are and our relation and thus no objects or ideas interfare...so eternalized,the end...(Misty smiles )..anyhow,and i knew you'll
get so much better overnight once you were with me again all the time.."
Misty(smile) : "You broke in and all,and i had a mixed
feeling,i didn't want to do anything,just sat on your Lap
and that was my moment still.."
Ash(smile) : "you sat so sweetly as i said barely managed not to hug you to death(Misty smiles and huggs Ash) Kanto Water Empress,most beautiful and
skillful Sensational Sister...Ash Ketchum,the little boy
from Pallet,always there..(hugging Misty very firmly)first sight ‘my Ash’ that’s it,that’s my sweet soulmate Mist(Ash and Misty both keep hugging each other firmly)..and no Mist,i was extremely
sorry to know your state...very sorry..and your doses of (),
that just turned me into a complete devil..that day i
preyed upon my sweety to soul her(both giggle).. truely i
was in an extreme mood of verbal smackdown cause that was the dose for the m.. that were trying to delude you in your mind..i really had to warn the Lab staff off though they weren’t legally authorized there once i was in but i don’t know what i did to you and your condition none would’ve understood me and would’ve jumped and if they did i would’ve felt physically threatened and that would’ve been it cause you know my most sinister ones were there all together and if Crwadauntogator themselves got a hint,they being who they are,that lab wouldn’t have been anymore...(Misty tenders Ash’s cheeks and hair)..really Mist,my whole wrath was upon the veil that covered you and any distraction would’ve just imploded me,i told you about the gym and all and i really did feel then and there that like just beat it i’ll kill off all gyms from this world and then when i was saying die.die,die that was even more crazy..really only my soumate could’ve faced that and ‘my Ash’ would become ‘I’m Ash’(both smile at each other and hugs each other)...but i just thank God that i've got
you back cause there were just so many constraints and chances...i'm rather now realizing even more after i've got
you back both our pains,mine especially... that's why I just
want to be with you in Honeymoon..all i want..just gazing
at you, hugging you,being at your presence..i just want my soulmate and adore
her all day.. you're my whole being Mist..i cherish you
too,soully so much..just you"(both hug each other firmly for some time)
Misty(smile) : "anyway as i’ve souled my sweet bee,lets go to mount moon 2 sweety"
Ash(smile) : "right,then those dumbnuts pulled their trick
and you mentored max and was separated with Pikachu
from us when i was thinking about Pikachu and Brock
suddenly said don't worry Misty is with them,which just
gave me a shock cause(laugh,Misty Laughs)yeah right,it
would've been a worry for us 2 years back that Pikachu was the one who had to look after yourself in such
situation but,then i realized (smile) that my flower had
really blossomed"
Misty(smile) : "i can never forget that dance and strangely
you were keeping May in between us"
Ash(smile) : "to gaze at you safely"
Misty(smile) : "so finally you decided to gaze at someone
intentionally"
Ash(smile,huggig Misty) : "not someone but my only flower..(Misty giggles)..yeah,and Mist certain b..(Misty Frowns)..
(laugh)..nah that's from undercover actually,comes
in Pinkeenberry(grin,Misty shakes her head and laughs,smile) anyhow
they have at first sight charmed me but gazing to me is all
about you(smile)...it was not how you looked or
anything..but i just loved to keep gazing at your face rather to say your whole being enticed me since the first sight,just my Mist...it's
majestic feeling(hugs Misty firmly,Misty too hugs Ash)"
Misty(smile) : "but,Ash try to cut that language,i know you're
feeling guilty about your actions to me yesterday and all
that,but please we're married now, it's ok..and it's ok,we
will be at Pinkenberry all alone for a long time.."
Ash(smile) : "right,so i gazed at you and obviously May
would understand and(laugh)threatened me to break my
head with stones at night unless i proposed,to which i
said she'll as usual eat too much and fall asleep,to which
she compelled Brock to ration my food and her "normal"food between poor Max and himself and scowled them to
gulp that up(both laughs) 10 years yet so very fresh in my
memory..(both smile)..so she starved herself and me,to
which i smirked that now great we'll eat each other
up,then she smirked that she'll be the best for both,then i
said if you slept off,she wisely nodded girls are always
more tensed(both laugh),when i said i've seen that,she frowned and
again then really said something i wish(sigh) i paid more
attention to..but anyway,i've my flower(smiles at
Misty,Misty giggles) she said that if i don't then even if
another boy doesn't or you yourself don't it'll only pain us
both,then i thought she won't let me sleep tonight plus
you were anyhow leaving as Daisy and gang were upto
their old dirty tricks(both laugh)..but again i now realize their trouble too,’you’re the reason for all this misfortune,sisters or show’(both brusts into laughter),what a night(both laughs)anyway,so i myself was also
desperate,did she tell you anything"
Misty(smile) : "she was here and there talking about Drew
as if to suggest me from my own experience,which she
was trying to portray as a travel companion
environment,and i easily realized what she was upto(both
laugh,Ash shakes his head) so i just played along,and yes
that day she implied to me that you want to meet,but i
also implied its always if other people aren't
evsdropping,which obviously dissapointed her(laugh) and
then we spoke(giggle)"
Ash(giggle) : "right,i just about didn't have the right words
and talked about your pokemons..well Gyarados that
is(Misty laughs)..and then we had that hand holding and
just slipped our fingers through againt each others
fingures and all that,and yet i just stammered along and then finally i kinda forcefully hugged you
and just said you're my best ever friend"
Misty(laugh) : "actually that really was your way of saying
you cherished me and i got that and answered you in your
language but didn't do much..i just wanted you to burn for
me with longing,as I thought then you'll have to confess
and i just loved that day so much"
Ash(smile) : "right,next morning May opined that it
would've been so much better if i did this and that,to
which i said next time i'll take the rose from Drew
personally,which dissuaded her from pestering both you
and me(laugh)..but(laugh)..yesterday’s confession is nowhere worldly..(both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "really Ash,from yesterday’s perspective just every seriousness or emotion or whatever even in that moment just makes no sense at all,’i’ll admit 3 things and ask 1 question’,’please’,’can i add two more questions before’(both brusts into laughter)..’what now’,’can i namecall you’(both brusts into laughter)..then finally i said whatever and you confess then still(both laugh)..’so i’m marrying a namecalled’ (both brusts into laughter),’yes as usual you namecalled”(both brusts into laughter)  really Ash,that was something else none would realize outside what we were doing(both smile) anyway back to mount moon 2(both smile) and then Brock was you know as usual always wanted me to jump and since that day also started to give a piece
of his mind everyday to you"
Ash(sigh) : "yeah he did,Mist,but i still can't come.."
Misty(frown) : "again dear?"
Ash(smile) : "ok,ok,i won't (Misty smiles),yeah so after my
3rd frontier symbol,i just couldn't take it anymore and one
day just phoned you and spoke my mind too emotionally"
Misty(smile) : "right,but Ash,that was music to my years
cause i was only waiting for the inevitability,and then you
were so so sweet"
Ash(smile) : "right,and then well,May and all came to know and
all that till i won Battle Frontier and straight went to
Cerulian,Mist if only i knew those.."
Misty(laugh) : "no let them sleep for now,ok?"
Ash(smile) : "my conversations with you became more
and more intense but i being a jerk,it was either pokemon
or your gym battles that's all"
Misty(smile) : "Ash,you're so sweet and then were even
more as you were just about becoming a youth,it was
amusing for me,and i always knew how much you loved
my poses and winks.."
Ash(smile) : oh! i died for those winks Mist,really,and your
poses were as beautiful as ever,just that jovial self yours shined through and i felt like never stop gazing your pictures and it was heaven,and then that..um.."
Misty(smirk) : "want those(laugh)?"
Ash(smile) : "soully(both smile)..so your kisses were
actually a big trouble cause they caught me and all
that,infact Dawn nonchalantly told me to do the same to you with her
lipsticks(both brusts into laughter).."
Misty(laugh) : "May helped the letters right?"
Ash (laugh) : "pretty much that's why they became very strange (botg laughs)..but you know my thing never were those i just liked to just get lost at your presece and all else just those pictures and calls then were emotions and now i’m soully Mistyvious(both smile and hug each other firmly)"
Misty(smile) : "soully,no Ash your beat-downs yesterday also has broken all of those from my mind as well but (laugh)..thank God i didn’t have to see Dark Night: Library Bookself Version(both brusts into laughter)... but your pictures made my day though i
was so terribly busy then,just in the shows and so on,but
people pestered me as well then,which i did tell you but
you always in all your sweetness either didn't realize or
brushed them off and that really made my day cause i
realized the insignificance more"
Ash(smile) : "right,um..just a sideshow(Misty
Laughs),those Godforsaken brats if are still
around,beware,(closed eyes,smile)i feel hungry,very hungry(both laughs)...so
i went straight to Cerulian and the first thing happened
was LillieDevil(both laughed) "who are you?where are you
from?why are you not at Viridian?why your hair is like
this?which perfume do you use?",then suddenly Daisy
remembers me and goes like "aww,the Hoenn Champion
Ash right",i said i just won Battle Frontier,to Violet's utter
confusion as she has never heard of it(both laughs) then
Lillie tells them its just that sideshow(both laugh) and looks at me
carefully when i somehow manage to say may i meet
Misty, Daisy goes like what i mean by meeting, whether i
know her,if i'm a fan they have no time for me and so
on,then i finally had to call them by their names and
remind me who i was,then they wisely pointed out that
the meeting is not possible to which Violet scoffed them saying this is so romantic and so on(both laughs),in the meantime
someone told them they were needed and they reluctantly
told me to go to the guest room and you were out for that
day..before that Violet pointed out to be more romantic,i must throw that henius cap away first(both laughs).."
Misty: "yeah,i went to Viridian actually for show,came
back got a verbal smack for inviting my boyfriend without
telling them(both laugh) and so on,when i finally pointed
out your second Gym battle there and all that,did they
finally warm upto you"
Ash : "yeah and then they started to cajole me into the
battling for them..(both brusts into laughter) then i finally
could meet you and confess my feelings for you and all
that and um.."
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "had our first kiss..till
yesterday my favourite moment"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "yeah, though i kinda never
expected it but had to give in to my emotions and you
actually made the situation normal"
Misty(smile) : "right!Ash,now you can understand my
position.."
Ash(smile) : "yeah,it really made your 2 years
actually(both smile) then of course i went back home the
very next day went to Sinnoh cause Gary had some great
new pokemons(both laughs) and then you know we were talking everyday and our relationship became clear and normal and all that,which saved me too by-the-way(both brusts into laughter)..then that Sinnoh League win
happened and umm(solemn)..things started to change"
Misty(smile) : "later dear,i want to go back(both
laugh)..restart from your phone confession(both laugh)"
Ash(smile) : "yeah the 1st and 2nd symbol..well it was
heart-wrenching..Mist, I really never even thought that you
could ever long for someone else so i was sort of sure
that i'll see you sweet face beaming again amd again..so
first two was a bit strange,i just couldn't let go of your
memories and my chu-bro would tell me that,this is Misty-
showing your things all the time and i guess he only
realized i want to meet you..then after my 3rd and you
were talking..well i got too close to the screen(both
laughs)..and sorta could feel your presence.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah and i just kinda automatically
puckered my lips and it was a really romantic moment.."
Ash(smile) : "but then somehow i refrained from kissing
you(both laugh) through the screen (both laugh)..but i just
knew..my sweet sweet chu-bro said just like i did with him,i now also want to fondle Misty(both laugh)..so
anyway next day..um.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah,next day,i knew you just were unable
to take it anymore,so just mouthed off any challenger..
(laugh).. alright.."
Ash(laugh) : "right,those damn brats that were alive that day if comes around, Gangerized version Crawdauntogator is patiently
waiting(both brusts into laughter).. they're hungry,very
hungry(both brusts into laughter)...yeah so then?"
Misty(smile) : "then i was just overjoyed and all and you
finally called and was gibberishing(both laugh)..so i just
kinda told you how i was a bit tired and want to rest on
the table so that i could come very close to the screen(both
laugh)..
Ash(laugh) : "yeah,mystyvious(both laugh,Misty smirks and tenders Ash’s hair)..no just the gibberish first(both laughs)..i just had a field day(both laughs)..and while not with my bunch just saw you everywhere(both smile)..then i thought how to approach you cause you were like my own self(both smile)..then came up with the idea of Whirl Cup of all more to appease you cause you won(both brusts into laughter)..so was gibberishing like..”
Misty(laugh) : “the bits i remember ‘um..great match’ 500 times(both laughs),’you looked so bea..um..gracefull’ 5000 times(both laughs) and finally ‘your’re just um..i mean..such a..um..frie..um..special person to me’ like a million times(both brusts into laughter),then i just wanted to push you to destruction(laugh,giggle at Ash,Ash smiles at her)..”
Ash(smile) : “so as soon as you came near the screen i just felt like imploding(smile,Misty tenders Ash’s cheeks) so i just couldn't take that anymore and
said i cherished you for so long and went all
over..Mist,that really was a great feeling(both giggle).."
Misty(smile) : "yeah and i was also so happy i just
reciprocated and kissed the screen(both smile).."
Ash(Laugh) : "to which i said on the cheeks(both brusts
into laughter)...anyhow then i personally phoned you
most because of sweet talks(both laugh) which were obviously sweeter Gyarados talks(both brusts into laughter) and all..then Gary insinuated May and they found out you kissed
picture(smile)..i did preserve the kiss but then just
faded(both laugh)..then you sent another such then won
Battle Frontier only after that i really was established as a grown up person(both laughs)..May decided to part,Max went back to start his
journey..Brock as usual wasn't sure whether another was
due or not but i went straight to Cerulian for 7 days(both
laugh)..told mom Mist is now my girlfriend and i'll see her later many times but Mist herself told me she may have
to go away for a long time without contact(both brusts
into laughter).."
Misty(laugh) : "mom later told me,the first thing you said like ‘Hi Mom!
remember Misty, she's my girlfriend now’(both brusts into
laughter)..and mom was kinda taken aback(both
laughs)..but she knew it all along anyway(both smile).."
Ash(laugh) : “Professor Oak said all the problems that have had happened is due to the marriage i was talking about being due for 17 years(both brusts into laughter) and not happening exactly then(both laughs)..the whole world knew except so and so but no vulture could’ve done anything as i’m all mistyvious(hugs Misty firmly and Misty also hugs Ash firmly and keep staring into each other’s eyes for a few moments)..”
Misty(hugging Ash,smile) : “my sweet bee,return(both smile)”
Ash(smile) : "right then of course those 7 days,Ceruliam
Cape,the Dates(laugh)..both have had a good dose of it i
guess..(both laugh).."
Misty(laugh) : "i'll always remember,'would you go to a
date if i ask you now',No,why, you're a stranger,you date
only known people then’(both brusts into laughter).."
Ash(laugh) : "then your shows,the songs..well infact i
never knew why Violate was a gym leader anyway(both
brusts into laughter)..i knew Daisy,you told she was
always good i saw that one day..but it just never
interested her..and Lillie was never concentrated..Violet..
(laugh)..how many(both laugh)?"
Misty(laugh) : "thrice in whole life(both brusts into
laughter)..after i returned only once(both brusts into
laughter)..and you know she'd say 1 on 1,first hit,Mantine
return,here's your badge(both brusts into laughter)..never
even bothered to have a second(both brusts intolaughter).."
Ash : "yeah but in shows i knew what Violet was once in
her environment..but i only gazed at you(both
laughes)..and i could see what other people were
doing..and one man one day probably thought i was
rather gazing like i know you very well..hey man do you
know her,yeah second cousin(both brusts into
laughter)..so that was it..um..just a bit(Misty brusts into
laughter)..those forsaken brats if are around that ever
even looked at my flower,i'm starving (both brusts into
laughter)..but Mist i only later realized boys were ok i
know girls far more dangerous (both laughes)..cause they
just want to know everything about you so that they can
immitate and all..I saw 4 shows..final day finally sweet
sweet Trace is there(both brusts into laughter)..i knew the
brat knows not one thing except swimming like 10
hours(both brusts into laughter)..and you carried him
throughout and he just didn't know what to do(both
laughed)..Trace was out didn't know i was in audience so
when i say hi,he was like why are you not in any
leagues(both brusts into laughter)...so had fun then that
moment there..in full night total seclusion your space that
was..once i entered i knew you had Mistyvious ideas(both
brusts into laughter)..but then again(both brusts in laughter..”
Misty(smile) : "just wanted to kiss you for may be like 8
years(both laughs)..so just went off and once i went very
close you just asked 'Mist,um..may i..um..have a.."(both
brusts into laughter).."
Ash(laugh) : "yeah ,and you straight came in front of me
with your typical mistyvious wink and smile and i got totally dissolved(both smile at each other) and and we had our kiss,a very long one too(both brusts
into laughter)..more like 80 years (both laughs)..anyhow,i
though didn't feel awkward but just a bit puzzled because
i knew you like better than the back of my hands(both smiles at each other) and like never have
been in that position and situation (both laugh)..so a strange stuff..during our kiss all i thought
was how much i cherised you and all that..it was great,it
was great.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah..i kinda completely lost myself and
so many emotions and all.. yesterday when you were
going like spit and caugh(laugh)..i felt really sad.."
Ash(solemn) : "um..Mist,i did hurt you but we.."
Misty(smile) : "that was then Ash,long long ago,this is soully(both
smile)..and then..um..i felt kinda awkward cause i knew you like myself as well(both smile) and then just like was so overjoyed and all(both giggle at each other) and never really wanted to meet
you the next day but then you just hugged me(both
laugh)..and then we went to the pool had fun there,well i
tried to kiss you everytime i saw you(both laugh)..but you
said may be the first word of wisdom i ever heard from you(both
laugh).."sweetness turns bitter if tasted too much"(both brusts into laughter)..so desisted..and then you again went,and it was the same phonecalls,pictures and all.."
Ash(smile) : "well i hugged you the next day cause i thought as you were avoiding me(both laugh) as i might’ve done something very wrong(both brusts into laughter)..so just hugged you and then itself you were again just wanted to be all over(both laughs)..no Mist,i got you fully at that moment how devoted you were cause you knew i’d go away again for ages and all your gym leader etc things went away and i saw how sweet you are and all mine(tendering Misty’s cheeks,Misty smiles)..that self i want to see all the time soully(both hug each other firmly for a few moments)...the rest around the gym my department(both smile)...except(both brusts into laughter)..anyway then again had to depart for the next league,just went to Sinnoh,Brock went in,May
came to know about us by the end,Max obviously realized
2 years later(both laugh)..i told Brock minus the kiss(both
brusts into laughter)..he was happy just patted me..Trace
was so overjoyed said like why didn't you call me(both
brusts into laughter)..anyhow then I met Dawn..her first
question is like Hi!I'm Dawn,tell me about your girlfriend's
favourite perfume(both brusts into laughter)..she was she..but she
wasn't like May(both laughes)..much matured and
absolutely cocky(both laughs)..was a sweet little girl
really..and Brock was much changed then but he told me
that this will really be his last trip so just to learn the
basics cause i still had two more regions left..and really i
was so oblivious,by the end of battle frontier you told me
many times and to learn those so i did a little..but then Sinnoh
went on got 16 badges and two ribbons,well that always
bored me to hell(both brusts into laughter)..and Drew
would always go like,5 minutes break it up in 50
pats(both brusts into laughter)..and May said no only
5(both laughs) then Dawn finally reviewed it must be 27(both laughs)..Dawn coerced me saying it'll
help me..so just went along..it was a different experience and good one cause before that i had two shared with May,these two were mine only,kind of an experience..i guess Sinnoh finally made me a man in all senses..(both smile).."
Misty(smile,hugging Ash firmly) : "um,Ash.. detail all your journeys.."
Ash(giggle) : "at your service as ever(Misty giggles)..
15,May-17,April,Indigo
17,May-18,May,Orange
18,June-20,June,Jhoto
these were with my sweet sweet Mist flower(both giggle
and hug)..but(laugh)..there was Trace(both laughes)..i can never
forget that brat(both laugh)..i wish he atleast came once
more and especially when Dawn was around(both laugh) and Brock was there as well those three would’ve created a massacare there..(laugh)..i guess i should’ve dragged Trace there and do his works at gym(both laugh)...but i'll now pester him(both laughes) for the rest
of my life(both laughs)..and you know i unnecessarily wasted a month
in Jhoto(both laughs).."
Misty (smirk) : "too much flower(both brusts into
laughter)"
Ash(smile) : "yeah,just didn't want to be away from you at
all..and you were in heaven that 5 year patience
finally(both laughs).."
Misty(smile) : "i always knew you only ever looked at me
like that..never anyone else..but i just wasn't sure...
but(smile)..now soully souled(both smile and hug)"
Ash(smile) : "i know what my sweety wasn’t sure about(hugging Misty very firmly,Misty looks into Ash’s eyes smiling)..it was whether or not ‘my Ash was adoring me all the time’(smile,tenders Misty’s hair,Misty hugs Ash firmly,smiling)...
then back at the journey->
20,July-22,June,Hoenn,our reunion at 21,April..i had to live
without my sweety for 9 months..but i really became your
fan after that Mist(both smile)..that night i was always
with you,well Gyarados actually..(both brusts intolaughter).."
Misty(smile) : "could you have beaten my Gyarados in
Hoenn?"
Ash(smile) : "gyms no championships yes but from upto quarters only and only with distinct type advantage like Pikachu or Snorlax but Crawdaunt or Feraligator even then could’ve beaten her as well(both laugh) but Heracross no(both brusts into laughter)..the reunion day i myself would’ve been in pokemon centre for a week(both laugh)..only when i was in the quarters,you know that feeling of invincibility...but you know Mist,if you too were a trainer like me we would’ve tied throughout our career at all points creating a record(both smile) but i’ve very rarely faced Gyarados though throughout my whole career a few times in championships well Hoenn itself being one,surprize surprize(both laughs) then in Gyms Unova and Sinnoh may be 4 times but against Gyarados it was always you not me(both laughs) and you know that Sinnoh final and my problem with your Gyarados is exactly that(both laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : “chu-bro prefers the little sister(both laughs)”
Ash(smile) : “yeah but by then i had the initial form of Crawdanuntogator(both laughs)..Mist,i’m nothing to your knowledge on water types but those two pests are truely once only(both laughs)..”
Misty(smile) : "Ash,i'm a hall of fame myself but you really
have i mean.. it's just impossible to think what only just
those two can do and they are just so so common everywhere abadauntly found and they’ve fooled around with Team Rocket highest boss,it’s just impossible..it’s soulmate really.."
Ash(smile) : "yeah,just letting them be who they are but(laugh)try Goldy with them(both
brusts into laughter)..anyway then 
Batrle Frontier from 22,July-
23,December,Battle Frontier
then with my flower for a week
then 24,January-26,February,Sinnoh,that really made
me then Pokemon Master..well the normal one(both
brusts into laughter)”
Misty(smile) : "yeah you really got very matured during
Sinnoh and when you returned were the exact dream man for me(Ash laughs,Misty laughs a bit later),unintellectual that is(both brusts into laughter)..and i was very happy..i mean you really mastered the sweet talk then(both brusts into laughter)..about
Gyarados still(both brusts into laughter).."
Ash(smile) : "right!infact i should be ever grateful to Gyarados for doing the beau-talking(both brusts into laughter) that too for like 7 years(both brusts into laughter)..actually you know i never told anyone
about my first kiss myself and still hasn’t and later when
they pressed me i would always say why were they
interested at all and so on,Dawn was always very excited about us but never went into overdrive like May who well had reasons(both laughs),Dawn had her
own goals,Brock had changed quite a lot and we just
trodden along, your name absolutely skyrocketed just after i left for Sinnoh and was supreme and i was very
happy for you then"
Misty(smile) : "yeah,and you were my relief as well as i
could talk about pokemons with you all day which here
was hard to do unless Trace was present"
Ash(smile) : "right,(frwon) that dumb buff..(Misty frowns)..anyway...(smile)but you remember that final..by the way
Daisy never forgave me for never giving you a flower
bouquet though(both laughs)till the great discourse(both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(smile) : "Ash,your two gifts Battle Frontier Trophy
and Sinnoh League, Especially Sinnoh league,you know
saved me many times actually.."
Ash(sigh) : "Mist,really you too need time in Pinkenberry"
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "i'm having every bit of it Ash,
don't worry"
Ash(hugging Misty) "right!"
Misty(smile) : "those two were you know what set Men
out of Boys,especially that Pikachu vs All in Sinnoh,that
was the Pokemon Master"
Ash(hugging Misty) : "i guess Mist,i guess.but um..(Misty
again laughes)..(laugh) time for brat break(both
laughes)..those who pesterd my sweet little flower,i'm
famished (both brusts into laughter),please i beg of you,please come by 12 at night(both brusts into laughter)....well you know Mist,that was my life that after this many years you get a certificate or medal or Trophy so that really was the prize and i thought it would be nice(Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s cheeks,Ash smiles too)..the Orange as you know went to Professor Oak,Hoenn i gave to Brock obviously then those two,then Unova i didn’t give to anyone(hugging Misty firmly) thats all for my sweety to retake(both smile),Kalos had to go to Professor Kukui simply due to the undercover and all and Elite4 they give medals only so yeah,that really was my present(smile)..”
Misty(smile,hugging Ash firmly) : “my sweet sweet bee(Ash giggles)..but really Ash,nothing like Sinnoh discourse(both brusts into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah,i’ll remeber myself as well,kinda came off,wanna listen again(smile,Misty smiles and nods)->
Psychic has to see you,so agility
Fire has to stay calm with your antics,so irritate
Ground has to keep you grounded,so springboard
Dark will show you might,so feign weakness
Direct type disadvantage thinks you are a bully(Gyarados),so befriend..(Misty laughs)..well chu won’t do beau-monitoring(both brusts into laughter)..
Dragon would underestimate you,so startle
Ghost has to engage you to the plays(Ganger),so compete..this was hardest part cause chu had to play which he never liked unless friends or mutual friends and somehow managed only
Grass would try to finish you quickly,keep patience...this was hard as in this one chu was a quite tired trying to appease Ganger of all(both laugh)..but just after the very first attack i said if i don’t win this i’ll never become what i want to be in mental signals which he was catching by then just around his self discovery of power became very perceptive,so this statement makes sure he kept his patience and then that legendary thunder-chair the first time i saw it before only read and thus shouted then,thus the miracle completed with one of the most elusive and miraculous attack and that was a big thing...”
Misty(smile) : “How was your feeling now as a review that you had then?”
Ash(smile) : “well i realized many things that Final day and so on,Pikachu's powers and my
intuitive powers really did give me the breakthrough,that i
just knew what to do to win any match in any situation
against just about anyone,except Gyarados(both laughs)...i lost in Unova only once on a best of 3 gym challenge in the second hall of fame gym that i went to,this was the very first match..
but other things happened and then the breakup
and then team rocket came around,where i had to be very
carefull,and it also was a big thing cause it was life/death of many dependent upon you and your bunch and all about your nerves,but then i really didn't care,was in my
own mood,own oblivion and fortunately my skills in
battling did defeat team rocket juniors and then finally the great boss but well(both laughs)..that gave me the very basis of my current plane(both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(smile) : "yeah busting team rocket just about
8 months after our breakup and the way how it was done and all that was happening i
really also thought your head had spun just too much as you might’ve understood you don’t have any match and
all that, otherwise by the end of the 2nd month right upto
6th i thought of the reconciliation many times but but
never quite proceeded and you know all the rest.."
Ash(smile) : "well i only wish i wasn't such a dumb
buffoon as well,but you know i was and then i went to
Kalos,exactly where you should’ve been with me AWOL(both laughs) and by the end of it i knew i had no many match in
this world when it comes to battling... just after Unova i had
only one match but that too like match in the sense her best level against my then current level which was only to get better and the match was Laura,were almost 90 by
then and i met her in Sinnoh when i won the league there
and she instantly recognized my just blossoming levels and really blessed me much and she actually did tell me
that i'll surpass her just after the next league victory and anyone else ever that she knew..she just said
your Pikachu itself is a miracle..i did tell her about
you,which to my surprize she knew rather well via one of
her relatives from next generation having woked in
Cerulian recetly"
Misty : "yeah,you called her and introduced me to her
from the Gym,and i spoke with her only on that day and
she really was very kind"
Ash(smile) : "yeah,as you know a real legend in all
departments,and(hugging Misty) you'll be such very soon Mist."
Mist(smile) : "i want(hugs Ash)this only"
Ash(smile) : "have all the time,as usual(both giggle)then of course
i won Kalos like i did and i just knew now i don't have any
match at all and basically i knew it was formality before i
got into hall of fame and Elite 4 happened,after the very
first Elite4 with those brats and all,i knew i have become
once only very concretely and i won't be able to battle long..so just
oriented the group and somehoe finished(both laugh)..but
my personal problems just erupted as well anyhow all
things finally came to be settled forever yesterday,as i had
MY FLOWER(both hugging each other smile)"
Misty(smile) : "but i want to restart again(both smile)"
Ash(smile) : "anything all the time(both smile)..
so, i come back from Sinnoh now a 4 weeks break and
again 3 weeks at Cerulian (both brusts into laughter)..this
time none of those 3 were there but Sarah of all was
instructed (both laughes)..She comes are you a
challenger are you a vistior,are you the official observer(both
laugh)..and i said i'm a challenger..(laugh)..none is here
now come at 3:30(both brusts into laughter)...then i
showed my Sinnoh title..ah!your Ash Ketchum..and goes
all over..then she ofcourse realizes about me and you
called you,i challenged you(laugh)..and then went all over
in pool(both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "yeah,that Sinnoh title and before that that
discourse you were a real star too then..so i just asked
Sarah she says new trainer 4 badges,Hoenn,2nd
region(both laughes)..so then I go and there’s You(smile)..so
sweet..then the challenge,you go like i choose Ash(laugh)
and jump into the pool..really you scared me with that
dive(both).."
Ash(laugh) : "nah just seeing you adrenaline stuff(both
laugh)..then my sweety sweetly came with the typical gracefully sweet dive(Misty laughs) and had a very good very long
hug(both laughs) and all the fooling around(both hugs each other very firmly)..then(laugh)..again
someone comes new challenger and i just said tell them
Sinnoh League's new champion Ash Ketchum is here cause this is his quote “VERY OWN” cousin's gym(both brusts into laughter)..so for
that day the Gym is shut and quote “NONE WERE THERE”(both brusts into laughter..then we had so much fun and
all that..and that was the time i was telling you yesterday Mist,yeah i didn’t fully understand your antics(smile,Misty laughs) then were just your heart wrenching longing for me otherwise i would’ve got formally engaged then as well cause after that i could’ve travelled without a trouble and any moment come back via relation or take you there(both smile)..anyway still beautiful times..Brock of course decided to go to
become a Doctor,Trace was just about beeing around Daisy flower i saw(both
laughs)but still the bufoon took 5 more years(both brusts into laughter)..and so on..you really were on top of your fame
then..good times really..that time i actually thought i had
stayed enough and we kinda had an understanding.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah true..we sort of matured and you only
had 2 leagues left..we both were very happy..Ash,i never
realized how much danger we and you then took up,so
difficult isn't it 2 years and all those places.."
Ash(smile) : "true Mist very much,well in Kalos i hiked
barely cause there's more cities and all and i had my
different intentions there but Unova i went in
26,April-28,September..that really was my tuning
point...my skills were just it was every day a thousand
new things and then attention,i completed 30 Gyms
there and all that..Iris and Cilan barely kept up with
me..that was Iri’s third and she was pretty matured girl of 23/24 was a different relationship entirely and rather competed with me and could hold her own and all and as Cilan told me much later went to Hoenn next won then Orange which she couldn’t win but found her soulmate in Hoenn and now according to Cilan just wants to settle down(both smile)..then there was the devil Cilan(both laughs)..he was very nice and all that,but then of course eventually comes to know about you(both laughs) and goes all over(both laughs)..Iris’s very first Gym was Cerulian which means(both brusts into laughter)she’s no more sane(both laughs)..so Iris of course remembers you and just says congratulations and all,Cilan can’t believe it and asks me how the hell did i even get close to you(both laughs) to which i scoff that i’m a 4 league champion what does he expect(both laugh),but really you know Mist,that was my ego,i did joke and would do so again if i have to go back there but now it’ll be purely a joke then it had ego mixed with it in a very large quantity(both smile,Misty tenders Ash’s cheeks)..i still never told anybody naming you just said yes i’ve a girlfriend and that’s it but you know travel companions will eventually come to know..Cilan is a true admirer of yours and in my dark days always told me to keep the feet at on ground and not to leave you thinking i was a bigger star,thought actually that i got jealous of your name and then me being there wanted to compet(both smile)..anyhow then all attention and my everyday sudden realizations did create a mess and i just never knew what is what except when i was with my bunch(both smiles)..and i kinda just brushed you aside later cause i just thought what’s the matter Mist herself knows all about it and i’m anyhow going to return to her and had a plan actually to stay with you for 2 or 3 months(Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s hair) then may be more cause i was 3 years advanced than last age limit and just could travel to Kalos ages later but then backtracked cause didn’t want to let go of goal and all,then liked the show boating and parties where girls i saw would jump and when they crossed the line just told them i’ve a girldfriend and then scoffed if necessary that we’re devoted to each other since day one of our relationship and atleast my devotion wont stop increasing(Misty smiles) which dissuaded a few,then a few poses and all with my grwoing abilities,and you finally were fed up and all those m..(Misty sighs and shakes her head)(Grin)..undercover language(both laughs)..anyway all they did was to just moan that you’re not happy never telling me the real issue and i told them Mist says she doens’t want me to come back but she just is living her dream and i don’t want her to come here either breaking that we’re having a rough patch in professional lives but we know each other for more than 12 years it’s all chill and besides i’ll eventually be back and with only one region left i’ll stay there 3 months no trouble and all..but the great matured legends(Misty shakes her head) gets the thing totally upended as did Brock of all later when i told him all is cough and spit the venerable himself gets the meaning but suddenly wisdom dawns that that also then is my view of my flower of all,what an utmost buffoon(Misty shakes her head and laughs)...so these great legends says that their heart throb is infatuated but very sweet so i’m myself having my 12 year old infatuation broken now suddenly cheating yet am not worthy enough to know the real situation but suddenly underground sludges aren’t infatuated despite hanging around exactly like what that great b.. was doing to me in Kalos(Misty sighs and shakes her head).. and suddenly sludges are great venerable ones having the license to enter buildings where as if they were anticipating the break-up,what abject retardness is it to think if you’re not spitting at your girlfriend everytime your immature..(sternly,Misty tries to calm Ash down)...no Mist,it’s ok..i must for the sake of it,the legends themselves were infatuated with you and that’s why i never liked that responsibility stuff at all..anyhow..whatever..f.. just spoiled my mood”
Misty(hugging Ash very firmly,smile) : “sweety,you’re flower wants you now,come”
Ash(hugging Misty very firmly,angry) : “that’s why Pinkenberry and i won’t hear anything but neither me nor you will use phones if serious matter Orange Elite4 will be too glad to find us and inform us sooner than a wink,that’s my final say”
Misty(same pose) : “it’s all right dear,just calm down”
(Ash and Misty keeps hugging each other very firmly for a few minutes)
Ash : “anyhow,Unova,at first it was well then my head wasn't right then
our problems started and all that,you weren't in a good
place either,far worse than me..and that i really regret 30
is just a number you know..but anyway my flower is just
here(hugs Misty firmly,smiles,Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s cheeks)..by the end of Unova
i knew i could go toe to toe and may be even betterElite4..but i came back and all that.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah you were great but then pressure
upon me was always increasing and you also weren't that
close it seemed always became about how great this
party was or what you could do..then may be for the first
time in like 8 years i screamed at you and you were rather
flustered and all..then i realized you came to and
agreement with press and all but just always seemed very
far..just profesaional life..and yeah i cheris you..and here
peole were constantly hanging around me and all
that..Trace was my only link with normalcy..and i'd always
tell him keep a tab on Ash,he's gonna get
bamboozled..and he did what he could do..Brock went so
busy..did meet me but was rather all into his own stuffs..i
just felt lonely..i realized then Ash,as you said yesterday..
truely i do need you so much.. it's just not fulfilled without
you.."
Ash : "yeah i just brushed aside your troubles and all..that
was being bufoon..and then we just came to that day
when i,Mist,i still regret that and that's what i was telling
you..i was killing myself as well..i just told you i'm busy i
dont wait for guys to come into the doorstep..just if i said
random people,it goes completely different place..and
you never cared but then these brats..i'm sorry really Mist"Misty(smile) : "yeah,just a guy pestered me to much..and
then,but Ash(hugging Ash),just take your break(both
brusts into laughter)
Ash(laugh) : "those damn brats tried to talk with my sweet
flower,i'm salivating,the hunger and then the prey..please i
beg of you..just come around..i'll feraligate you(all brusts
into laughter)..how many times you used Glalie?"
Misty(smile) : "few times.. just too good,i didn't think except my Goldy anybody including Gyarados could've beaten her if she was on the mood..but now
probably same i guess(laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "she's a lesser gem(both laugh) but still more
than any legendary pest if she wants to be(both
laughs)..her thing is that she'll say you look ugly,this will
check that etc(both laughs)..so now Gyarados will be asked questions why your tentacles are't polished enough?(both brust into laughter)..true pests my bunch.."
Misty(laugh) : "far sane with me(both laughes)..yeah,i just
couldn't believe your words as like till yesterday when you showed
me what you did,soulmate..and i just got angry..then that
day wasn't good..and i always thought about
reconciliation but just never knew and you went
undercover..so we just only had your those words and
all.."
Ash : "yeah,well i went Undercover from 28,November-
29,June
and went to Kalos in 29August-31,July
then I went through Elite4..
31,September - Unova and Sludge attack..(both laugh)  
31,November - Sinnoh|32,January - Hoenn|32,February - Kalos|32,March - Jhoto|32,May - Orange|32,June - Kanto

so yeah,by then you know
i cut off from Brock and Trace on 28 November itself as they kept pestering me and by the time I reaches Kanto Elite4,i really didn't have any
touch whatsoever with my roots..my nights went in deep
studies or fooled around with Ganger or Noivern or Gerninja or someone other..it
was like as you said yesterday..Pokemon or hell.. just no
respite...then i planned and got you this month.. really i
even came home since 26,June..more than 3 years..i
really was somewhere else..and these 3 has made me
what i'm now.. especially Kalos..but Mist,really..just lets
fly off to Pinkenberry...
Ash(laugh) : "i guess,but you'll forever be a miracle
monger,i saw Gyarados and then the flamethrower,i was
rather so jealous of you as i thought i want that,but then..
(blush)..um..i turned back at you and you were smirking
at me saying that it was rather very impressive than only
impressive with a rather proud face then i went into
flashback and recalled,and i'm naratting this to you now
cause i was too flustered before to do so but you looked
nice that day,i already felt
Ash(laugh) : "indeed,i organized for a show battle in onthe sea insinuating i never got the respect i deserved
from my favourite City and then you know a few wise
brats from the gym implied to the press that the king is
only after the queen only for you to vehemently deny it
and get you even more angry..(solemn)..Mist(hugging
Misty),i..um.."
Misty(smile,looking at Ash) : "i'm right here,dear"
Ash(smile) : "right,so there was already too much
interest,but then before the day i trash talked you..(very
grave) Misty,this was the darke.."
Misty(smile) : "Ash,it was enough for me to be able to see
you again live after so many years,well rather having been
forced to(laugh)that trash talking was far better than
anything i was hearing before,(beaming) Ash,you
know,none could've got upto my nerves like you did by
simply calling me a in Lil's childhood word "runt"
repeatedly exactly the same way she did that you heard
and those bug pokemon jokes were just..just blown my
head off"
Ash(solemn) : "um..anyhow i should make the amends
right now..so i said for an utter buffoon that i was i still
could smell some fishy things were going around the
Gym,which now i just can't help but want to thrash left
and right,anyhow,i whined about the food,the gym leaders looks,the pokemons nonsense behaviour proving the
staffs were rather useless,so in a way riled everyone
up,and as that forced you out to fight me and so on"
Misty(laugh) : "that fight was the best,i ust went prepared
and then out of blue you offered to show all your
pokemons and then showing Pikachu and saying you'll
want me to choose for you and i just screamed at you just
as i used to when we were 15 which was after many
months actually,i was so solitary.."
Ash : "yeah,i had to carry on my antics and the crowd
were suddenly all poured into it when i played my trick by
offering that chorus which actually was to affect your
pokemons only.."
Misty(laugh) : "that was really like i just couldn't imagine
and none of my pokemons were able to do anything,i was
too agitated and confused to tell them to counter with the
same trick,which still wouldn't have worked would it Ash?"
Ash(smile) : "no not,you just didn't have that jovial
self as i said my bunch is impossible to defeat either a tie or a victory and to tie you had to be jovial means (hugging Misty firmly,Misty also hugs Ash fimly)my sweet cherished flower would've been beaming in my arms(both smile)..once Golduck of all was confused,and that's exactly
what Pikachu was there for doing,i knew it's a matter of
time till the crowd just forces you to quit..you know
Mist..now at my level, except you i mean then you had so
many troubles..but except you nobody really can stop
me..but of course my flower is my flower(huggs Mistyfirmly,Misty huggs Ash,smile)..and my flower only can
stop me cause the moment she appears across the
field,i'll just jump off and hug my flower all i want(both
laughs)"
Misty(smile,hugging Ash) : "and i'm all about my sweet
bee.."
Ash(smile) : "but then you were agitated and i just took
the advantage,(both laugh)..well i still wanted to hug you
to death when we did that handshake (both laugh)..and
that's why the gloves(both brusts into laughter).."
Misty(smile) : "really,that was something,i just sweared
you to which you again retorted with the Psyduck jokes
then i just had given up and finally had to tell you to try to
fight me one on one(laugh)which Snorlax did to an extent
that i still can't help but laugh"
Ash(smile) : "yes,it was hard cause none of my pokemons
was ever going to battle in the first place and Gyarados
first charged but with that typical Snorlax yawn she was
so utterly flustered that she just flamethrowed him,to
which Snorlax,just went into the water
Misty(laugh) : "then i told Gyarados to to do the ultimate
Gyarados Rage,it was just a suicidal attarck only for
Snorlax to tell her that "neither you nor your master don't
have any idea how to swim",which made her so flustered that Snorlax jumped on top of her head and kept
on doing the antics and telling her how to stay calm and
ask questions before doing anything (both laugh) that
finally made Gyarados so happy that she just gave
in...that jump itself,Ash i knew what Snorlax and you've
become..but that was funny Snorlax,your false alarm
when we were dating(both laugh)..that was real scary.."
Ash(frown) : "and some Cerulian brats even then had the
audacity to insinuate that this wasn't funny(laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "really,Cerulian and you have become like
water and fire..anyhow I was just too shocked to do
anything and finally tried Dewgong vs Pikachu which
Pikachu just went away with trying to balance himself on
him and lightly iron telling him each time he discomforted
it, Dewgong was just too known to Pikachu and despite
they never liked each other,my poor boy just couldn't think
that this is not a play..and then i realized your trick of
sentimental tactics and screamed you off as a cheat
barely restraining myself from talking all about us to the
crowd"
Ash(smile) : "that i myself will,not by words but by
action,when my official marriage ceremony takes place
exactly there,me marrying my cherished flower the infinite
and one more time(hugging Misty,Misty smiles and hugsAsh)"
Misty(laugh) : "and won't they insinuate anything then?"
Ash(smile) : "that's the point Mist,when they do i'll tell
them i wanted my flower and my flower wanted me,if any
brat has any trouble with that i'll play the hometown
Pokemon Master Hall of Fame card, insinuating that
Cerulian never gave me my due which Viridian did,to
which they'll point to my flower,self contradicting
themselves to my point that I CHERISH MY FLOWER and
my flower cherishes me(hugging Misty)"
Misty(laugh, hugging Ash) : "surely,and that's exactly why
you didn't go on their invitation didn't you, mouthing off
the "Showoff Gym" with a "young Dramabook Sinister
Princess" roaming around like an "Old Venerable
Venasaur(laugh)?"
Ash(solemn, hugging Misty firmly) : "um..Mist,you.."
Misty(frown) : "hey,cut it off,would ya?we're just having
fun."
Ash(whinning) : "umm..no..my flower before that has to
spend 1 year in Pinkenberry.."
Misty(laugh) : "Ash,we'll go there, don't be so upset about
it"
Ash(whinning) : "no,i want to runaway with my flower
tonight.."Misty(brusts into laughter) : "mom said too much
imagination"
Ash(brusts into laughter) : "absolutely not"
Misty(smile) : "anyhow then i screamed and the referee
said draw and i lose"
Ash(smile) : "actually on that whole night that was my
best bit as i told before that i get to date you,so i said first
handshake and once that was done,'thats our date,thank
you 'mam(both laughs)"
Misty(smile) : "what did you say in those hangouts and
date away there?"
Ash(laugh) : "well after undercover the logic of swearing
was very clear to me(both laugh)..so in Kalos parties
like,'hi!i'm this a date/hangout"..well i never danced with
anyone except you till Kalos when we broke up..and you
know the rest.. it's only my flower whoose touch is exactly
that flower to me(both smiles to each other)..rest well
once Serena pesterd me,danced with her friend (both
brusts into laughter)..another two times i said i like to
dance without any contact(both laugh)..so they just
finished in a minute(both laugh)..so i'd go 'yay,i heard you,
what's the meaning of the name'(both brusts into
laughter)..and then a few pokemons,when they tried to go
personal,'thanks for sharing your knowledge,see youlater'(both laugh)..few wanted to talk further..Unova was
different..'do you have a girl'..and the way they looked the
damn pus and blood..i'd say 'i have a girlfriend whoose
very very devoted to me and we cherish each other
beyond limits'..that ended the discussion there but some
people..'who is she' as so on..'nah,i can only say this
much,sorry if i'm being rude'..and that's it..my abject
failure was only not having the realization that Cerulian
Gym needed my presence for atleast 3 weeks..and even
after i was so flustered after our break-up,i never even
thought i could go back to you and instantly cut everyone
off..just called you once the day after and you were gym
battling so i thought it's just that that's it and the Gym
once more,where Berge told me nothing can happen,
don't disturb...so i just returned and talked with
Trace,Brock etc and i was so puzzled that all they thought
was that as i told you why why why..it just felt like Misty
was all i never had any part in our relationship..so at first i
just told them don't get into my business as i knew Trace
and Daisy were close and Viol if ever liked anyone it was
Brock and viseversa..Gary and Lillie has very similar
characters and Gary kinda had a bit of feelings for her..so
i just sternly told them forget me and don't get detached
because i broke up..Gary only got my clue that i meant nomore business about Cerulian Gym for me but you should
go your way just don't disturb me..rest you know,again
and again Misty is unhappy and all..i told them i don't
want to hear,i've got one league left and that's all i know
later me and Misty can patch up..and you know me
Mist..it just i mean 13 years and I just thought that was
really it..i never felt why should I talk again with you cause
i just never thought of you like just everyone,you were
always different to me and I was 28..i just thought that
well so much then..and i also never really bothered to find
anyone cause it was as you said Misty or bust,
absolutely...now Trace went on,patch up..he was as good
as ever but then one day i just couldn't keep it to me
anymore,and i never sweared like that,in Unova or
otherwise may be one or two bad words but that day it
just went off.."
Misty : "Trace didn't return to Cerulian after that for two
weeks only phone,that too rare with me only Daisy,then
when he did he told me Ash i think isn't going to come
back easily and said he told me things that has just
broken me apart beyond imagination and he really was
very depressed.."
Ash : "yeah,then Brock..same thing almost..but he went
ahead saying find someone else exactly like you,that justturned my head so much i straight went up and said
you're nothing but blodd and all and showed a
document,a book page actually(both laugh)..and said
read it if you can...his interpretation helped him,but he
thought my flower is the same as any sludge to me,so
was absolutely incensed..Max just asked me once or
twice,i just brushed aside,Dawn same,Iris barely had any
contact with me,me and Iria was purely professional
relationship though she was sweet.."
Misty : "yeah,she hardly had any contact with me either
but yeah later cut off,Cilan as i told you once after break-
up and that's it..."
Ash :"yeah,just chided me once but has still some
contact,very professional.. doesn't say anything
personal..i did tell him after our break-up whether he
wants to have a date with you to know everything about
you(both laugh) as he was such a big fan,he just scoffed
at me saying how can you say that about your girlfriend
and so on..i pointed out that she's no more my
girlfriend,to which he got flustered and chided me but
said he won't go much cause i may think he indeed
wanted to date you(both laugh)..very frank guy..since then
never spoke except once that i may try to patch up but
then again said none of his business..truely a goodprofessional guy..and i have no contacts with Clemont
and Serena only calls profeasor oak..i gave you her
details cause i actually wanted to show how you're
behaving even after so much humiliation and knowing
that this girl was with me and so on.."
Misty(smirk) : "hum.. Ashy-boy?so much faith in Mist
right?(giggle)"
Ash(smile) : "and my flower kept it..(both hug each other
firmly)...yeah,
then 28,December-29,June,Undercover.
well they got me in November just as i decided i'll go for
Kalos..so just went along,started from January till
May,June was final,July took a rest,August go out to
Kalos...in June i was at (),where Violet went and all that,i
just sent my under-cover beaus(both laugh) there..yeah
they'll be in Pinkenberry only(both brusts into
laughter)..they extracted Violet's personal info, learnt
about Brock,then i send an unnamed letter to Mr Kane
Slate insinuating (both laugh) that Violet still has Brock in
her mind and that's all..well i mouthed Trace and Brock
off in November and it was 7 months so i knew
Brock being him certainly must have throughly
changed..so yeah that was really it anout Cerulian and all
you know,after that i took a month rest at Professor Kukui's lab and all that,there Dawn's parents came and
met me,had a chat and all and Drew and May came...well
Drew was upset with me cause he thought finally ego has
caught me up but he never showed that openly just told
me not to get too carried away,this was before
Undercover,after that he never mentioned personal
matters at all...then May,she was again beaking my head
off,why,why,why,why..i just said why do you want to
know,are you thinking of breaking up as well..she was
very upset and sad and then just said she'll never discuss
anything personal about me but she will as usual tell me
if she really broke up or not..then she contacted me
sometimes and all just light chatting same as Drew...till i
sweared her off on her anniversary..that was a big
mistake from me..anyhow then that fiasco with Serena
happened and all that..then the sludge attack,i just had
given up on everything un-pokemon(laugh,Misty smiles
and hugs Ash firmly)...Gary never talked about anything
personal neither Trace,well Trace would just give the
phone to staffs but rarely very brief just reports,we called
each other by surnames(laugh,Misty smiles)..Gary only
said when he got engaged to Lillie and later married her
and then about his future, that's it..i was happy for him
and all,and now he didn't mention the name Lillie at all cause else i probably would've mouthed him as well(laugh,Misty
smiles)..oh and once Professor Oak told me Trace got
married to Daisy,naming her..so i just said good news
that's all..i had no news about you except papers and here
and there those i never cared about..the sludge attack i
realized it would be hard so i got even more ferocious and
all..and yeah 29,August-31,July was Kalos,28,
September,November, was Elite4s,Unova,Sinnoh,sludge attack at Unova itself..then
29,January,February,March,May which was Hoenn,Kalos,Jhoto and Orange finally
in June went to Kanto Elite4,then my flower again
appeared to save me from insanity and just now in
August,i've married my soulmate Misty Waterflower(both
smile at each other hugging each other firmly)"
Misty(smile) : "Ash,Kalos studies probably helped you to
get through Jhoto right?"
Ash(smile) : "yeah pretty much,but you know i never won
Jhoto and so i just thought i had a score to settle so was
very determined...Orange was extremely painful..well
during Jhoto i had an extremely strong pungent feeling
but somehow brushed it off..then studied again but after
Jhoto i really had not much direction cause only Orange
and Kanto were left,Orange i've already won and only
Kanto..but you know i never wanted to face Lance,hehimself infact persisted..you know you've to travel to all
the gyms whoose badge you have and that's why Kalos
was so busy and took my focus off..then you know all
your memories in Jhoto...oh and Pettlesburg was great
Norman and () were extremely professional,not one word
about May or Max or about me nothing just very formal
visit..so i was ok..but Jhoto i told them from before no
personal questions at all and none dis..so that was all
right but those feelings were very pungent though i was
focused and brushed them off but then Orange had to
come and i knew i was in trouble but just went on and all
sorts of personal questions were asked..Jhoto of course
knows all about you and got the clue that I don't want to
remember you,those who remembered you that is and
there was 4 only..but Orange you know they knew
everything but too zealous,Danny i told you,Rudy first
thing after formality how great Misty is doing,to which i
just told him i don't know anything about her for the last
13 years i parted ways after Orange she went back to the
gym only had brief contacts for one year but i just don't
know what happened to her at all but i'm very happy to
hear she's doing well and i heard it before so yeah,it was
ok...but all our memories were really troubling me and
somehow got over,then Officially i had to meet you andFoster but Kanto being my own region and last i could
pick and choose and that's why it was the last,i didn't
want to come as i already had 6 victories for Hall of Fame
qualification but Lance persisted and couldn't say no..but
went to all gyms even Viridian and Pewter,telling Foster
that please don't ask me any personal things..he obliged
as he was the one who requested me all the time and
begged almost later so i had to come...then after Lance i
knew my career has come to a complete halt then with
my level i saw the next 40/50 years just absolutely
nothing to do at all...i thought of going back to Kalos buy
a library and rest there then thought no Professor Kukui's
Lab,i take up a job after resignation here from the hall,and
just play around with my bunch and else..i just didn't have
any goal at all..but then as God may have it..i came to
know about my sweet Mist and her plight and then i still
was unsure but then i had the final Soulmate realization
and just just jumped upon my Mist..and she's my wife
now(both hug each other firmly and smile at each
other)..."
Misty(smile) : "you never looked at me like anything
ordinary Ash, neither did I...your personal life made no
sense without me and viseversa...i thought i should call
but waited for you a bit then 2nd to 6th i thought i shouldreconcile cause i knew how stubborn you are but then
you were undercover,Lance only knew and I desperately
asked him,he told me it's a secret..i told him that i am his
girlfriend but our relationship is on very low ebbs and so i
just wanted to know,this was via Professor Oak,so that
broke my heart even more cause there was no hope may
be i would've never saw you again and that only reminded
me of none other than Mom's condition,she as well didn't
understand our break-up and then this..i was desparate to
get out and so was doing this and that..but could never
actually go to date..yeah spoke with guys and said ok let's
date..but just as i had to go,i just couldn't as i can never
imagine a random bloke even touching me on a date or
something i mean personal..date to me was synonymous
with my Ash and that's all...so i just didn't know then 2
years passed all my sisters went away and it was really
horrible there so i started to do what i was doing,then Hall
of Fame and that craze and it made me even more sad
cause Gym leader hall of fame is so so difficult..and it
just went on..and i just truely went to use those poisons..i
just wanted to forget you and i couldn't..but (smile)..i'm
soully with my Ash now(both hug each other firmly and
smiling at each other)"only for my pokemons to get me in and then i broke into
your room,till then that record was playing constantly
around the Gym,which they couldn't catch as it was fit
with my own dress."
Misty(hugging Ash) : "when is that date happening?"
Ash(solemn) : "um..Mist, yesterday when i was torturing
you.."
Misty(frown) : "which ended with our happy marriage,cut
to the exact part"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "right,my flower is looking very
bright since then"
Misty(smile,hugging Ash) : "and so is my bee.continue."
Ash(smile) : "i'll date my flower exactly there every
morning and evening after(scowl) she has to appease
some chosen goddamn b.."
Misty(frown) : "yeah we all know that."
Ash(concerned) : "um..no Mist,you were always so tired
everyday,those brats will queue in from 6 in the morning
till 5 in the morning,so..(Misty laughs)..7:30-8:30 and 10-
11 everyday.."
Misty(laugh) : "Ash,i'll have to study too.."
Ash(frown) : "the goddamn articles..and you also will
have to give presentations?"
Misty(smile) : "reports on my Pokemons,Staffs,all ofit,well Sarah writes but i have to go thorough and sign and
all that,then you have to fix this and that..a Gym
sometimes is a real pest and feels like a cage.."
Ash(tenderly cajoling Misty's cheeks,solemn) : "so much
strain my little flower had to go through all for a
godforsaken brat like me.."
Misty(frown) : "Ash!"
Ash(solemn) : "um..no,my flower has to be beaming all
the time and i'll take care of those dumb things
myself,besides,they'll pester me as well..(laugh).."
Misty(laugh) : "infinitely more than me,you have the whole
world to look after"
Ash(frown) : "i'll only take care of one thing and.."
Misty(laugh) : "Vulture or Brat?"
Ash(scowl) : "anybody that dares to come around the gym
anytime except 11-11:15 strictly with 7 league tiles and
31 Kanto badges..i'll show them otherwise.."
Misty(laugh) : "all right,we'll date atleast 5 full day a week
Ash(scowl) : "6"
Misty(smile) : "Ash,you want to go to the cape on a
Fullmoon 2 am in summer? it's heaven"
Ash(frown) : "umm..but,my flower may catch..um..heat.."
Misty(smile) : "right,so we're going there every fool moon"
Ash(smile) : "everyday would do(scowl)given no otherbrat has the audacity to come anywhere near the whole
cape..um..that whole day"
Misty(laugh) : "you'll love Cerulian Ash,you'll see"
Ash(smile) : "only my flower and (showing the ring)what
my flower gave me from there"
Misty(smile,holding Ash's neck) : "really Ash, there's just
so much to do with you,and now finally only you(hugging
Ash)"
Ash(smile, hugging Misty) : "right,but um..want to know
about the precise observation(both brusts into laughter)?"
Misty(laugh) : "Ash, I can't believe how you even know
when i have to go to washroom..(both laugh)..(tendering
Ash).. precisely soulmate(both giggle)"
Ash(smile) : "well,at first i had to observe you for my own
safety(both laughes uncontrollably)..then just after one
month it was may be infatuation but from 3rd month i just
just always wanted to look at your face all the time..it
wasn't that i won't get a bit charmed by other good
looking girls..but it was just that one moment that's
all..you were totally different...i never still consider you
say beautiful or good looking.."
Misty(smile) : "soully wordplay"
Ash(smile) : "right..well i knew your whole body cause we
were always together as do you but it is too i know like it'smy own..you never appeared to me as a cute girl whoose
dying for me all time,it was just that your presence was
so sweet and enticing to me,later just grew and i guess all
the previous states was for yesterday..soully unified with
my sweet soulmate Mist(both beam and smile)"
Misty(smile) : "yeah Ash,i much later realized it during the
last 5 months of depression you and rest... you gazed at
me at it then i didn't realize but later i saw many sludges
and then i realized what you had for me which was more
cleared later..you ever looked at me like your very very
own..just didn't make any difference to you..never saw
that in anyone else and now i know it's only you(smiles)"
Ash(smile) : "yeah,your eyes too,you ever looked at my
face with blind devotion and while fighting (both laugh)..i
was more afraid that you sometimes came so close that
you'll kiss my head off(both laugh).."
Misty(laugh) : "i wanted to do that so many times
Ash(both smile)..but at the moment i always thought
you're my very own,a kiss just won't define my adoration
for you..and your whole presence too so sweet to
me...truely Soulmates can have that much naturality
between them.."
Ash(smile) : "yeah,so true..for us we just didn't know
anything except each other"Misty(smile) : "Soulmate"
(both hug each other very firmly and smile at each other)
Misty(smile) : "Ash remember our battle at Whirl and for
Totodile? i'll always love those two cause before that
truely we were too mischievous with each other"
Ash(laugh) : "i had no respect for you as being any good
in our entire 5 years travel,Whirl i was playing along as a
sportsman"
Misty(smile) : "but your idea of me being a miracle
monger hasn't changed since the day you saw Gyarados"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "am i wrong?"
Misty(laugh) : "i can never forget Gyarados' plight against
Snorlax ever"
Ash(smile) : "that's exactly why i can't battle at all any
more Officially,my condition won't allow me"
Misty : "Ash,your pokemons would still battle if i tell them
to right?"
Ash : "yeah sure but you'll have to finish quickly and
handle them a bit carefully,they're all just always waiting
for the very next moment of fun,unless you can agree
some false alarms..but most importantly they'll never
attack anyone it'll be just to teach you the art of the
attack(both laughes uncontrollably)"Misty : "yeah you're right,but actually the only time they'll
seriously battle is if it's Life and Death ain't it?and false
alarms will only give accordingly limited opportunity
where they'll be a bit too serious than just fooling around"
Ash : "yeah pretty much,i only need them for momentary
defense thats all,and my ultimate compells me to die
right beside them"
Misty : "yes Ash,that you have to"
Ash : "you've only set that with Dewgong and Golduck
Mist,but(concerned) um..you still can get agitated
sometimes given those brats.."
Misty(smile) : "yeah,but you'll be there with me"
Ash(smile) : "right,but Mist,i've not heard your singing for
such a long time..the way you hummed those songs and
later sang to me,but i prefer your humming more(both
smile)..just humming,you get a little better then ok?"
Misty(smile) :
Ash(hugging Misty,smile) : "that made my whole day"
Misty(hugging Ash,smile) : "anytime"
.......
Ash(solemn) : "Mist,you cried very much yesterday and
twice gave me some scare by almost fainting and then
those 10/15 minutes you lied on the grass sobbing
uncontrollably finally coming to the realizations"Misty(smile) : "dear,you were being honest with yourself
that's all"
Ash : "still,um..i just want something..
Misty(smile) : "Viridian Lake?"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty) : "Perfect, tomorrow night,we
go to Pinkenberry on Charizard"
Misty(laugh) : "you want to avoid everybody right?"
Ash(smile) : "Mist,there are many totally islands in Orange
where very few people go that too for day to day life,we
can stay in any of those all our lives without anyone ever
knowing our whereabouts"
Misty(laugh) : "where would the kids go?"
Ash(smile) : "on Charizard"
Misty(smile,Looking at Ash) : "we'll see about that,ok?"
Ash(smile) : "ok,but not so easy so though with
kids(laugh)i can't swear left and right and bash Cerulian
Vultures at all then."
Misty(hugging,looking at Ash) : "it's all right Ash,just that.."
Ash(hugging and looking at Misty,smile) : "all in good
times dear,all in good times."
(both hug for a long time)
..........
Misty(smile) : "Ash,tell me,you already knew i was allyours even before you confronted me yesterday,right?"
Ash(smile) : "umm..i guessed it but you know i had to
absolutely confirm..but Mist(hugging Misty,solemn).."
Misty(smile,hugging Ash) : "Ash,it's alright! as we broke
up i was confused,Green knew me and i knew him in
childhood then he was a nice guy and Brock was so
dissapointed in you that..Ash,cut it"
Ash(frown) : "no i won't i'll kill Brock as soon as i see that
brat..(solemn)Mist,i can't believe Brock of all people
could..could.."
Misty(scoff) : "Ash! get a hold on youself!"
Ash(dejected,hugging Misty) : "agree to spend a month in
Pinkenberry,only then."
Misty(smile,hugging Ash) : "1 week dear,you'll be bored
yourself that long"
Ash : "surely my grave was good enough as i told
Brock,indeed.So kinds tried to impress things upon you
leading you to cut him off..and Trace?
Misty(sigh) : "Trace never got out of confusion about you
and as he was with Daisy,this idea that i will only be
healed staying away gripped him entirely,so later i had to
cut off"
Ash(sigh) : "this en.. hasn't changed, anyhow,Brock
realized something himself about himself and given hischaracter could change himself very quickly"
Misty : "right"
Ash(smile) : "and i know about those brats enough,nah!
as much as i would love to but i can't feel but sympathy
for them and they're not going the rounds for sure,Unlike
Serena.."
Misty(smile) : "neither is Serena"
Ash(laugh) : "i hope so,but our treatments has been
similar,same words even"
Misty(laugh) : "natural"
......
Brock : "oh..um..hi Ash.."
Ash(extremely grave) : "why is it so Brock,that i find
there's 3 particular names among which 1 is extremely
extremely important to you as if for this NAME you have a
bit too much,a bit too desparate,a bit too intense,a bit
too.."
Brock : "Ash,it was a mistake,you know as well then that
your rounds which you told us earlier was only intuitive to
you as well..and.."
Ash(laugh) : "i told you a d.. l... r..?"
Brock(sigh) : "i much later came to know that you saved
me actually.."Ash(frown) : "later?later?why is it so o Brocko that i've
found people being obsessed with a particular word
"BEST" are a bit too emotional,bit too on the edge,bit too.."
Brock(sigh) : "Ash,please stop it.i know you did your
rounds obsessively to a point where now if asked you
just.."
Ash(smile) : "sweet sweet Brock,have you seen that just
like you.."
Brock : "yeah,alright, don't get so excited,yes cong.."
Ash(smile) : "sweet sweet.."
Brock(sigh) : "Man,you need rest..ok,ok,you need to spend
many months only with Misty in a secluded place and
that i shouldn't have ever disturbed you yesterday.."
Ash(scowl) : "was that a challenge Brock?"
Brock(sigh) : "fine..we should've ever known that you and
Misty got married the very moment you two met each
other,and i having just come along afterwards should've
been the very first one to stand up and declare it when
time came..
Ash(grave) : "your coming with me immediately to
Viridian Forest lake,NOW,just phone home say you'll be
late"
Brock : "hey.."Ash(frown) : "you saw Ganger right? don't try me,Mist is
there as well so you won't be killed thanks to her"
Brock : "um..at this.."
Ash(smile) : "Brocko,Brocko,Brocko,you don't want to play
games again do you? i played a great match with Trace in
the morning that his great grandchildren will love to
recall,comply or the result won't be very sweet"
Brock(sigh) : "alright come on.."
.....
Misty(smile) : "hi,Brock(laugh) Brock he's Ash,our little
pal..sit down.."
Brock(looking at Ash) : "he doesn't look so little any more"
Ash(smile) : "Brock do you.."
Brock(sigh) : "Ash,please,i know what you're trying to get
to and Misty only came cause your not in a good
condition,Ash we're sorry, alright,you made our day this
morning for the rest of our lives, things happen.."
Ash(smile) : "like i was (Misty frowns at Ash)NOT RIGHT?"
Brock(sigh) : "alright, alright,I'll talk with Misty and you'll
just watch over if i somehow was rude to her,if i'm shoot
me all you want(Misty laughs) it's not funny Misty,your
husband is hellbent on proving to everyone that he was
right about you and viseversa and so unless we really
confess it the umpteenth and another time,he'll notdesist(Misty brusts into laughter) and if we don't comply
he'll set his Ganger and Crawdauntogator on us who
would pester and fonele us to our next life sooner than
we would like(Misty laughs loudly)Please Ash,i didn't say
anything wrong"
Ash(smile) : "sweet,sweet Brock.."
Misty(laughing) : "Brock,you guys are so afraid of him all
the time,he just wants to go to honeymoon as quickly as
he can..this is this first place where we met,and i told him
to see if he could get you which he happily obliged"
Brock : "at this.."
Ash(smile) : "lucy already knows it,i told her,but Brock
what was it that you were insi.."
Misty(sigh) : "Ash,i'll talk remember"
Ash(sigh) : "alright but(smile) sweet sweet..(Misty again
laughs)"
Brock(sigh) : "Ash,really, you're just too playful all the
time,i didn't insinuate anything"
Ash(smile) : "you didn.."
Misty(laugh) : "Ash,i got this,ok?he wants to prove he's not
the best choice but forever is the choice that is we are
ever like this- like I'm Ash and He's Misty, Soulmates,one
entity appearing as two to each other...but in between
according to him some friends didn't help him byagreeing to look after the Gym,and that is especially you
since you had been a gym leader and Cerulian provided
ample opportunities for your studies"
Ash(frown) : "and.."
Misty(laugh) : "he's saying that rock vs water type was no
excuse for someone like you who had more than enough
aptitude and knowledge"
Brock(sigh) : "Ash,i had my personal issues then,then lucy
came and i've understood my mistakes myself,i'm
extremely sorry and no no repercussion has taken place
from our mistakes for a long time and you just enjoy your
honeymoon with Misty it's all chill"
Ash(scowl) : "but i'm the BEST.."
Brock(sight) : "alright,i'll give the rigourous.."
Ash(frown) : "bash the Vultures(Misty laughs) for me and
f..(Misty frowns : "Ash!").. whatever,just bash Cerulian
Vultures (Misty brusts out in laughter)"
Brock : "you two little brats have always pestered me to
death(Misty laughs even more)Misty,cut it he's going to
completely devour me up unless you help(Misty tears out
of laughter)(sigh)Ash,those two terms.."
Ash(frowns) : "Vulture is anyone who tries to portray that
i'm a playboy and all my antics are deceit like if i'm
drinking a glass of water its not because of the fact thati'm thirsty,but its a ploy to actually get something else"
Brock(sigh, concern) : "Ash,we're sorry we beli.."
Ash(smile) : "you bel.."
Misty(frowns at Ash) : "Ash!beat it,i'm here"
Ash(whinning) : "my little flower was.."
Misty(sigh) : "Ash, it's alright..cut it"
Brock(smile) : "No,Ash,you really were
right,none..um..only..um(Misty laughs)..alright,you and
your flower were always together but a suddenly a herd of
vultures flown too quickly (Misty again brusts into
laughter)Misty,please help me on this..(Misty laughs
uncontrollably)(sigh) anyway.. flown too quickly towards
Cerulian causing a little gust which for a very short time
span that went away before anybody even could
realize,only giving you and your flower a little bit of
illusion that you weren't as cl..um..(Misty brusts into
laughter once more)a little bit closure wasn't immediately
needed(Misty laughs) but as soon as it went you and your
flower were again together and you didn't ever even
notice that you weren't at..umm(Misty laughs
uncontrollably)..anyhow you never even had the throught
that you didn't have to be..umm(Misty laughs)..you didn't
ever thought that you don't have to be closer to your
flower..which is you and your flower always only wants toget closer and closer..(Misty laughs)..happy?"
Ash(frown) : "Cerulian means all the brats that had the
audacity to challenge my flower uttering the word
"challenge" and all those who ever went there with the
scant thought of trying to even look at my flower(Misty
brusts into laughter) or those who ever said a bad word
about my flower must be immediately with their
godforsaken families packed off to hell(Misty laughs)"
Brock(sigh) : "all right..Misty,please make sure the
destination is absolutely empty including the sky(Misty
brusts into laughter again)..the Vultures went to the
Cerulian to..alright The Vultures flew from Cerulian to
Cerulian (Misty laughs) in a cyclic way that never created
an illusion in your mind that you had to be not getting
more close to your flower..(Misty brusts into laughter)..
happy.."
Ash(scowl) : "why is it so Brock that i've found Viridian
had the audacity to put a bike in that damned centre
where you work-a bike that came with this illusion that
me and my flower had to be parting?(Misty again laughs)"
Brock(sigh) : "Ash,please,may you with your flower be
always blessed,let me go Man,please(Misty brusts into
laughter)"
Ash(scoff) : "was that a threat Brock?(Misty laughs) thatwe're not always blessed,not.."
Brock(sigh) : "Ash,please!it's our mistake that we ever
thought there were two different things called Ash and
Misty as there really isn't and now we're so happy to know
that..(Misty giggles)"
Misty(smile) : "you just made our day Brock,thanks"
Brock(sigh) : "thanks Misty..uh,God saved me today(Misty
brusts into laughter)"
Ash(smile) : "sweet sweet Brock.."
Brock : "Misty,take him to honeymoon as quickly as
possible and don't return before a year(Misty brusts into
laughter again) and be always with him..(smile)..am I
wrong Ash?"
Ash(laugh) : "not at all, thanks man,have dinner here"
Brock(smile) : "thanks but.."
Ash(smiles) : "sweet sweet.."
Brock(sigh) : "alright,(Misty brusts into laughter) i'm not
cooking (Ash laughs),who has cooked?"
Ash(smile) : "yours truely,enjoy youself(goes to get the
dishes)"
Brock(laugh) : "Misty,all your 4 years only just this last few
minutes has completely erased away as if it truely was an
illusion"
Misty(giggle) : "exactly Brock,i've not laughed like this foryears..thanks to you and thanks to my beau(blush,smile)"
Brock(laugh) : "already poems are flowing all around"
Misty(blush,giggle) : "couldn't desist"
Brock(smile) : "Misty,i'm very sorry that i pressed him like
that this morning,but i can see he has just brushed
everything off as well"
Misty(smile) : "no i can't mind anymore as i also saw the
conclusion,which he repeats to just about everyone at
home and Lab and now they are self recognizing his word
only to avoid his verbal smacking like you just did,gave
Trace a real scare in the morning only to make him say by
himself exactly these but yours were far easier as i am
here, being with him you know like its been about 30
hours may be and we didn't sleep a win in between yet
you see how fresh we both are? in these 30 hours or so i
have had like every enotion possible and he gave me this
ring as i told you yesterday itself,Brock it just fells i've
been married to him eternally..and I can't believe it was so
easy to say this exact word,but with him it's just has
become too natural that you don't have any second
thoughts at all..i can't believe my luck either Brock...even
10 days ago at this very moment where i was and today
where i'm today...it's better than every dream i've ever
had(blush,giggle)"Brock(smile) : "very true,today morning i was telling lucy
of his words,antics and contents and this night also has
been wonderful,really it just truely feels that there never
were any separation at all among all of us,and i can't
believe he with such reputation and antics would just
brush it of like a dust particle in a matter of a day"
Misty(smile) : "right but(concerned) he has taken a big toll
himself mentally you know..his sweetness just allows him
to express even his grievance in a way that will make
those who doesn't like him to absolutely adore him"
Brock(smile) : "absolutely,Misty,you two are just as he
said always was is and will be together,but yeah take
good care of him and he does need you more than the
rest,Trace was smacked because Ash just don't want to
let you leave him for a moment right?
Misty(smile,blush) : "absolutely,but could you believe
Brock that the Ash we saw and my real heart-throb since
the first sight when i was 15 and now i'm 32..all 17 years
so much happening with all 3 of us,this is the biggest
evolution really and he's a once only living legend you
must've sensed his Pikachu's and his Ganger's ability?"
Brock : "absolute legend in all respect indeed and yeah
that Ash and this same thing but may be way sweeter
now always fooling around and not wanting ever to stopand just wanting to be with you all the time.
Misty(smile,Blush) : "yup, that's my Ash!"
